Q: What is the difference between the .ppc and .040 versions of the 
   cgxsystem.library?
A: It is only mem alignment that is different. The .ppc version 
   aligns bitmap data to cache line boundaries to avoid cache 
   line problems between 68k<->ppc. It is only required when 
   software does not take care of it. It's like a 'patch' for 
   software that does not do cache handling properly, 
   bitmap alignment can not be controlled by software.
 
Q: Why does the CV3D install disk say that I need to run enforcer
   if I have a Amiga 2000 with a 030 card?
A: Enforcer is needed for all machines that have a 030 and run 
   the CV3D in Z2 space. The problem is that the io register space 
   is in Z2 space with a2000 and Z2 space is always cachable if no 
   enforcer is running, since this space also intended for memory cards.
   The CV3D io register space interferes with that caching stuff.
   This is not a problem for a3000 and Z3. Also the 040 and 060 always 
   installs a mmu table at setpatch point (68040.library does that) 
   - the cache is invalidated for z2 space and CV3D works fine.
   This is what enforcer does for the 030.

Q: Do 15 and 16 bit modes have a big difference?
A: No, 15bit modes use the same definitions as the 16bit modes. They 
   are very similar beside the different bit ordering to represent 
   the actual color.

Q: AHI seems to have problems with CGX while booting.
A: Try ACTIVATE=1 in the AHI icon tooltype. Alos you might try
   upping the stack in the startup-sequence.. at the top..
   'stack 20000' or around there.

Q: In MUI->PSI there is a Interleaved option.. what does that mean?
A: Intuition "interleaved bitmap" flag. You can set this for screens 
   so that intuition will allocate a plane-interleaved bitmap for 
   the screen, instead of a normal one. It is not faster..No. It is 
   less flickery when scrolling.
   Normal screen: 
    One chunk of memory for every bitplane 
   Interleaved screen: 
    One large chunk of memory for all the bitplanes, with the lines
    being organized like this in a row: 
    [p1p1p1p1p1p1p1p1p2p2p2p2p2p2p2p3p3p3p3p3p3...] 
    i.e. all the planes are adjactant per line in memory 

   If you want to scroll a normal bitmap, you do a blitter run for 
   every plane in the bitmap, result: the well known color artefacts,
   as one plane is moved "before" the other in terms of scanline display 
   with a interleaved bitmap, you can do it all in one blitter run, 
   and all planes of a line are moved "at once", -> no artefacts.
   [it's only valid for planar screens, e.g. aga] - Oliver
   This has no effect on on CGX screens.


Q: Does SUPERLAYERS or SUPERGELS offer anything new for programmers,
   and how do they work?
A: SUPERLAYERS and SUPERGELS are both simply routines which replace OS
   routines in graphics and layers.library.
   SUPERGELS (just like the old gels patches found in CGX) basicly patches
    DrawGList, and doesn't offer any new API or anything. The fact that gels
    become transparent on >8bit screens is just a chosen way of working done
    by the author, nothing else. Note that there's A LOT in gels which
    SUPERGELS doesn't support, it was only meant for giving enough "emulation"
    to support WB and similiar simple drag'n'drop usage.

   SUPERLAYERS do however offer some new stuff which have been made into LVO
    calls in cgxsystem.library, but they are not really public, and I think
    Frank might never make them public, because they don't really add anything
    which in any way should extend the layers API.

   If I remember correctly, 4 calls can be used from a certain
   cgxsystem.library version and up, and these are:
   ShowWindow, HideWindow, InstallTransparentRegion, InstallTransparentRegionHook

   Show/HideWindow is simply a highlevel intuition-like call, which will
   cause an intuition window to visually disappear or reappear on its screen.
   SmartRefresh windows naturally are saved as normal. In fact, the whole
   Show/Hide thing is a quick and dirty method, because what actually happens
   is that the windows layers are moved behind a "superbackdrop" layer.
   These calls were meant for commodities or something.

   The transparent region functions lets you have norectangular
   layers (windows) by defining a region which will become a "see-through"
   region. The region is simply a normal region made using gfx.lib calls, and
   the whole call works very much the same way as InstallClipRegion, just
   that the effect is different. There's some tricks involved though, because
   (de)installing transparentregions in windows can cause damage to the
   actual window or underlying windows, but intuition won't know about this
   damage until next intuition event which causes a BorderPatrol (internal OS
   term for walking the window list and checking for damage, causing
   refresh(events)).

   Using the transparent hook, lets you compute new regions whenever the
   layer will change, ie. when the layer is about to resize, your hook will
   be called and let you resize the transparent region, so that the resize
   happens in one single operation, giving the best visual results. (instead
   of seeing the layer size first, and then the see-through region would
   change afterwards, causing unneeded backfill for example). By using a
   magic-cookie, such a kind of hook can also be passed when the layer is
   created, so that the hook gets called at creation time.)

   Note that a lot of rectangles in that transparent region can slow down
   things A LOT. For example, Troels made a circular window for testing, and
   consisting of 400 rectangles and more, it made OpaqueMove REALLY SLOW. But
   if you keep the count low, it works ok. - Trond

Q: Some answer I have no idea to what the question was :)
A: First, the link between layers.library and graphics.library is through
   the cliprects (see includes), and whatever changes you do to layers, you
   must in the end generate a cliprect list compatible with the cliprects as
   already defined and used by graphics.library. Graphics.library will both
   manually browse this cliprect list, but in most cases it uses
   DoHookClipRects() (V39 of layers) which will call a certain hook with a
   bitmap pointer, a rectangle, and an offset. This makes the whole rendering
   issue more "RTG" since layers becomes a more "black box", but sadly this
   call wasn't introduced from the very beginning so not all gfx.lib
   functions use it, and more importantly, calls like ScrollRaster will walk
   the cliprect list to figure out possible damageregions.
   
   If you get all this, you will understand that introducing masked cliprects
   will need redoing all gfx.lib calls to support this, and you might argue
   that this is possible because CGX is actually patching all this gfx.lib
   functions anyway, but I think you would need to buy Frank a ferrari to
   make him to implement masked cliprect support.
   
   However, there is a more dirty way of doing it which would make
   implementing it much easier, and that is making all those "masked
   cliprects" into smartrefresh buffer-cliprects, so that all gfx.lib calls
   would work like normal, because they think they're rendering to an
   offscreen buffer. And that is what actually happens too ofcourse, but the
   trick is to then "blit" the portion of the smartrefresh buffer which was
   affected into the screen through the mask which belongs to that
   smartrefresh buffer. There are still a lot of tweaking to do, and I'm sure
   one would encounter problems trying to implement it, but it would be an ok
   solution. Don't think it'll happen though. :) And ofcourse, it would eat
   some more memory, but on the other hand, it would make moving those
   cliprects around faster.
   
   The reason I made the TransparentRegion support was simply that it took 5
   minutes to include, because superlayers always used regions anyway, but
   those regions was always only one rectangle until I added those calls.
   
   As a last note: do understand that enlightment is bloated stuff and
   utterly slow beyond belief. At least it was, the last time I tested it. In
   fact, I made a enlightment-look-a-like layers test thing using superlayers
   transparent regions, and it was superslick, everything being "realtime".
   (although I must admit my test thing wasn't equally complex, but in this
   case it wasn't a big issue). - Trond

Q: Why do icons still use some chipram even though I run CGX that uses fastram?
A: Well, the icon format, ie. the DiskObject structure defines the image as
   an old style planar intuition image, and this is what all programs expect
   and rely on, including workbench. Such programs usually only reads the
   image structure for information and fills out an own planar bitmap
   structure, which gives them more freedom when rendering. (ie.
   BltBitMapRastPort with different minterms, and/or dummy 0x0 or 0xffffffff
   planepointers to give certain visual effects. Also, wb needs the planar
   images for the drag'n'drop which is planar only with AmigaOS). Birdie will
   intercept BltBitMapRastPort calls from wb and create cache of the bitmaps.
   This is basicly the same which happens when SUPERGELS in cgxV3 cache
   drag'n'drop style bobs as correct pixelformat bitmaps which are then used
   by my gobs routines. - Trond

Q: Would it be worthwhile to port SUPERLAYERS code to PPC?
A: Not worthwhile. SUPERLAYERS is not a bottleneck. On the contrary, if you
   simulate layer operations using superlayers, but with no graphical
   rendering involved, it's so fast you can have supersmooth "realtime
   operations" involving easily 100 or more layers.. maybe even on slow 030
   systems.. The "bottlenecks" are gfx-copying if smartrefresh is used, and rendering
   speed of applications if simplerefresh is used, which in turn means the
   amount of rendering, and speed of gfx.lib operations. - Trond

Q: Is CGFX able to do glitch-free double-buffering, ie where it swaps
   buffers during the vblank period?
A: Yes, it is beam synchronized. (with r69e and DRAGGIN=NO)

Q: Does CGX mirror the graphics in fastram even with the NODRAGGING=NO?  
   I have a 800x600x256 picture as a background and I'm showing about 
   1MB less of fastram because of it.
A: It ALWAYS uses fastram to swap back buffers. The buffer must be available all the time 
   You get into trouble if you need to swap out the buffer and don't get the memory.
   If it did not do this you probably would get trashed screens and memory corruption 
   Stability over mem usage is the key here.

Q: If I use the PPC version of the cgxsystem.library will CyberGraphX be faster?
A: NO! The ppc.library has some special memory allocation functions which 
   are used by the special ppc version of the cgxsystem.library.
   The upcomming PPC version of the V43DTs will use the PPC version
   of the cgxsystem.library.

Q: What does BMF_MINPLANES in AllocBitMap() mean when using CyberGraphX?
A: It is a kludge actually for the old picture.datatype. The OS uses it 
   all the time, so I took this as an indicator that friendbitmaps could 
   be allocated chunky and not in the old planar format. - Frank
  
Q: I run PatchControl and MCP (and other hacks/patches) in my startup-sequence 
   and CGX V3 seems to crash now.. can I fix this? (Or any other hack/patch)
A: You might try to move the hacks/patches (PatchControl, MCP, ect..) to 
   be run _after_ IPrefs in your startup-sequence and see how it works.
   Another thing would be to try to run the hack into nil, ie:
   "RUN > NIL: MCP" 

Q: CGX V3 seems to be crashing alot with my 060/PPC card.
A: See Q&A above. If that does not help you might try to use:
   setpatch 40.16 (02/14/94).  With later setpatches it's not sure what 
   has really been done and many have reported some kind of problem or another.

Q: When my Amiga boots up I only see the CGX bootlogo for a fraction of
   a second. Is there any way I can leave it up longer?
A: You can make the boologo stay on the screen longer by setting the ToolType
   BOOTLOGO=1 and set the tooltype PASSTROUGH=YES in your monitor file. 
   Then set the ENV VAR NOPASSTHROUGH to 1. If you wish to use NTSC or other
   non-cgx screen modes you can set the ENV VAR NOPASSTHROUGH back to 0 at the end
   of the 's:user-startup' with the line 'setenv CyberGraphX/NOPASSTHROUGH 0'.
A: #2 The bootlogo is only displayed for the time between monitor startup and 
   WB screen open. If you only see the bootlogo for a short time then you 
   just need to delay the opening of the WB screen. As soon as there is 
   con output at boot time it is opened. You could add the WAIT command
   to your startup-sequence before the 'loadwb' line... ie 'WAIT 2' will
   wait 2 seconds. (This will only work with CGX V3, it will not work with V2) 

Q: On the CV64 if CPUP2C is set to 0 will the Roxxler be used? 
A: On hardware accelerated planar2chunky converversion it will.
   On all cards having CPUP2C=0 will give faster results. The trade off
   is that on slower cards like PicassoII you will see some flicker.
   You can see this on something like FinalWriter®.

Q: I run a 1280x1024 screen and there is a "line on the right side of the
   screen". How can I fix this? 
A: You should try to lower the Pixclock to 100mhz or lower. Also anything 
   beyond 100MHz Pixclock will make the pointer flicker because it uses 
   a software crsr.

Q: How can CyberGraphX V3 run older CGX V2 software with the library names being 
   different?
A: When CGX V3 is run correctly it will create a resident library called
   cybergraphics.library The current version is 41.2. AGAIN this is a resident
   library. In RAM.

Q: Is there a way under CGX to see how much memory is free on the CGX card?
A: CGX does not have the functions to check this currently, this is in the
   works. 

Q: Why does MPEGA not play a .mp3 with cybergfx with just the -p option?
A: Just use -p and -d 2 because it can't play 44100hz on a cgx screen.
   It needs a productivity ecs/aga mode in the background but obviously 
   there is none ... sound dma is heavily dependant on display dma.

Q: I just installed CyberGraphX and I am having alot of problems.
A: First thing to do is REMOVE ALL HACKS from your startup-sequence
   and User-Statup and WBStartup. Then go from there.

Q: Do Winners use SmartRefresh? Should I use SmartRefresh or SimpleRefresh?
A: SHORT ANSWER
   NO! Remember to turn on SimpleRefresh in all applications where available. 
   With MUI, simply set the refresh with the Windows->Refresh gadget. The
   reason why you should avoid smartrefresh is that it uses a lot of RAM,
   and is also slow due to a lot of allocating/copying of gfx data. While
   smartrefresh was meaningful with slow CPU's and small amount of gfx data
   (low color ECS/AGA resolutions), it makes no sense with high color and big
   resolutions. In addition, the cliprect defined by old layers is so stupid,
   superlayers was unable to lessen the amount of gfx-data transfere
   happening. 

A: LONG ANSWER - by the Superlayers author
   With smartrefresh, the machine doesn't have to "think" very much, it
   simply copies a lot of gfx data, because the system automaticly saves and
   restores window contents. This copying from gfxcard<->fast ram is
   pretty slow, even with zorro III. Reading from gfxcard ram is worst, it's
   dead slow. With smartrefresh this happens all the time.
   ..
   With simple refresh, there's more "thinking" involved, because the system
   doesn't save and restore window contents. Instead it orders the
   application to redraw itself in the damaged portions of the window.
   ..
   Now, this is what happens in a typical "window-arrangement" situation (simplified):
   With "buffers" i mean offscreen bitmaps in fastram.
   ..
   Smartrefresh:
    - Allocation of buffers
    - Copying some stuff from old buffers to new buffers (fastram->fastram)
    - Copying some stuff from screen to new buffers (gfxram->fastram) VERY SLOW!
    - Moving on-screen gfx using blitter (VERY FAST)
    - Copying some stuff from old buffers to screen (fastram->gfxram) 
    - Free old buffers
   Simplerefresh:
    - Moving on-screen gfx using blitter (VERY FAST)
    - Repair damaged regions in the window, which usually means:
    - Text rendering
    - Linedrawing/Rectangle filling (blitter)
    - Image rendering, in other words copying from fastram->gfx ram
   Important:
    The amount of gfx needed to be renderd in the repair part is in most cases
    much smaller than the buffers dealed with when using smartrefresh.
    ..
    As you can see, simplerefresh involves much less data-moving, and is
    therefore generally the preferred method, but as you've experienced
    yourself, it's not always the case. Why? Because the repair part of the
    simplerefresh operations involves much more "thinking" than simply
    figureing out what to copy, like in a smartrefresh case. 
    ..
    So it all comes down to a balance between the ability to move gfxdata, 
    the amount of gfxdata (depth, resolution), and the raw cpu power.
    ..
    A very typical resolution, 1024*768*16, involves a lot of gfx data, and
    therefor simplerefresh is the superior choice, unless your cpu is so slow
    it is better off copying data. (a little more technical: when copying the
    cpu only does a small loop to copy memory, while with repair the cpu needs
    to execute a lot of code).
    ..
    I could do a lot more explaining, but I guess this is enough.. just a
    note: I could have speeded up smartrefresh operations A LOT with
    superlayers, but it is impossible because of how the old CBM guys defined
    the cliprect used by gfx.library. It's a shame really.. 
    ..
    Last note: if you have a lot of windows open and/or uses OpaqueMove/Size,
    then the smartrefresh becomes even slower compared to simple.

Q: Why doesn't work Scala with CyberGraphX anymore ? 
A: Make sure, you have the PLANES2FAST option disabled. While this works fine
   for most system use, programs like Scala get into trouble because they are 
   not aware of graphics cards installed in the system. 

Q: I can't get CyberGraphX to work with my new Apollo 4060 accelerator. Why ? 
A: The software setup of the 68060 on the Apollo card is not correct. Please 
   contact the manufacturer of this card to fix this problems.

Q: Why does the the Emplant driver seem not work with CGX V3?
A: When Asked on comp.sys.amiga.emulations: Why does the Emplant not work with 
   the CV3D the following was given:
    From: Jim Drew <msdei@ctaz.com>
    Reply-To: Jim Drew <msdei@ctaz.com>
    Subject: Re: CV/643D and Emplant Problem
    Date: Mon, 02 Jun 1997 14:25:51 +0000
     No driver will solve this problem.  The CV643D was released after
     Utilities Unlimited went out of business, so there was no driver written
     for it.
A: The emplant drivers 'peeks' inside the cgxbase library pointer.
   An simple update to the Emplant driver should make it work.
A: David Gorton - dgorton@dreamscape.com sent me this:
   "I have talked with Jim Drew about his CGXdrivers for Emplant MacPro. I realize
    that they do not work with V3 and CV64/3D does not support V2. Jim said he
    might never get to a patch or new driver for that product. Since his driver
    peeks inside the Cgxbase.library could this library be patched to allow that
    driver to work with V3? Or is there someone who might be able to fix them
    drivers. Jim would probably give up the sourse code, if asked!"


Q: I run CyberGraphV V2 with an older non-3D graphics card. 
   What will CyberGraphX V3 get me?
A: You will be able to run CyberGL (in 15/16/24 modes) and use the new 
   features like: improved CGX screen/view handling , horizontal dragging, 
   improved cgxmode, Multiple views , Multi monitor system support,
   Works completely without chip ram, Real memory management, 
   Support for multiple boards of the same kind, ect.....
   There will be no real speed improvement, actually V2 is quite
   fast already for most things.

Q: Why is PutPixels slower under V3 than V2?
A: Writepixel is not optimized for speed. Writepixel is actually not a
   speed indicator for a gfx emulation. Example: "If you drink beer
   you dont go to the market for every bottle... That would be silly...
   You would get a hold of a larger amount of bottles obviously...."
   No higher level functions like line drawing or filling rectangles or
   moving areas call writepixel to putpixels. This would be to slow
   by far. All those PutPixels tests are not really speed indicators
   for gfx cards.

Q: What is an example in the real world that uses PutPixel?
A: The mui buttons in the mui window title bar are drawn with a few WritePixels,
   actually some could do a special patch with does not allow writepixel at all ..
   you wont really notice the difference when working with the os.

Q: Why when you use a 24bit Workbench, and you use the menu option
   Window->View By->Name the file names or other parts of the text don't show up?
A: Workbench uses certain operations and calls to draw the text which are 
   not possible on a hi & true color (15/16/24bit) screen. This is not a bug with cgx.

Q: Flickering pointer? I run a 1152x900 screen and them mouse pointer seems
   to flicker alot. 
A: Flickering pointers have nothing to do with the resolution but the 
   pixelclock they selected in CGXMode ... Anything beyond 100MHz Pixclock 
   uses a software crsr.
