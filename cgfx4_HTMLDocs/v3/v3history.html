<H2><B>cgxsystem.library changes</B></H2>
------------------------------------------------------------------
41.20
- bitmaps for intuition screens are not cleared anymore before they are
  attached to the screen
- software line drawing code should now produce the same line for every
  color depth
- fixed a bug in planar BltPattern() complement mode with mask 
  replacement which e.g. fixes the crashes with TypeSmith's glyph
  filling option
- fixed bug in WriteLUTPixelArray()/cybergraphics. Format 0 now works 
  properly
- bumped cybergraphics.library version to 41.4


41.19 (r70a archive)
- added support for boundary aligned CyberGraphX bitmaps (e.g. required by
  Fusion)
- added new feature. If the mode you selected in ScreenMode prefs is not
  available when the Workbench screen is opened, CyberGraphX tries to
  find a replacement mode. If wb width and height were set to default
  mode dimensions, it uses a width of 640 and height of 480 by default.
- fixed a bug in the BltBitmap()/graphics minterm 0xc0 planar->planar
  code introduced in 41.18. blits with a width less than 32 did not work
  when both source and dest x were on a 32 pixel boundary
- added coordinate sanity checks to CyberGraphX's graphics.library/Draw()
  function since programs like VisualPrefs seem to call it with invalid
  (negative) coordinates which caused memory havoc in certain cases.
- ADDITIONAL NOTE: Some people reported that increasing stack size of the
  initial shell fixes certain boot problems. Try to add a stack command
  in the startup-sequence to check if it fixes anything.
  Also, there seems to be mount related problem with certain drivers that
  causes some systems to halt at boot time.
  The c:mount command does enforcer hits when there is no tooltype set
  for .info files in devs:dosdrivers. Unfortunately this can lead to a
  total system deadlock in certain cases. The AHI audio driver for example
  does not have ACTIVATE=(0|1) in its .info file and mounting it causes hits
  in most cases.
  Please fix it and check if booting the system works again without problems
  in case of any trouble.

41.18 (r70/PPC-CD archive)
- minor changes for the CGX AGA release


41.17 (r69f archive)
- fixed a long outstanding bug in the display mode installation code for
  OS 3.1. This bug could lead to loss of AGA/ECS mode monitor IDs when
  multiple graphics cards were installed in the system.
- cgxsystem.library.ppc now falls back into 040/060 mode if ppc.library
  can not be found.
- FillPixelArray()/cybergraphics does not trash register D2 anymore when
  rendering to a non layered rastport
- ADDITIONAL NOTE: If you experience any problems with cgxsystem.library.ppc
  please try the .040 version first to check if it solves your trouble 
  before reporting any bugs

41.16 (r69e archive)
- changed behaviour of custom bitmap support code for OpenScreenTagList()/
  intuition introduced in 41.15. This should  fix some problems with programs
  like Resource or CyberView which pass a custom bitmap to OpenScreenTagList()
- added CyberGraphX support for AllocScreenBuffer()/ChangeScreenBuffer()/
  FreeScreenBuffer() intuition calls
- GetBitMapAttr(bm,BMA_FLAGS)/graphics now sets the BMF_DISPLAYABLE flag
  for CyberGraphX displayable bitmaps
- fixed some problems in DrawEllipse()/graphics with overlapping pixels in
  complement drawing mode
- OpenScreenTagList()/intuition cleared the SA_ErrorCode long field in some
  cases although the screen was not opened properly. (-> e.g. CygnusED's
  Spawn new CED option never opened a new screen but a window because it
  always got an errorcode of 0)
- OpenScreenTagList()/intuition now uses the width/height parameters of the
  NewScreen structure instead of ignoring it and using the default dimensions.
- The mouse pointer should not jump around anymore if someone tries to drag a
  non draggable screen (if driver has dragging disabled). Fix requires latest
  drivers also)
- fixed an enforcer hit problem that occured in conjunction with the SysLock
  utility
- ADDITIONAL NOTE: If you experience any problems with cgxsystem.library.ppc
  please try the .040 version first to check if it solves your trouble 
  before reporting any bugs.

41.15 (r69d archive)
- hopefully fixes the crash problems introduced in r69c
- removed some debug output in the DoCDrawMethodTags()/cybergraphics call
  which was in r69c/41.14

41.14 (r69c archive)
- There is now a special ppc version of cgxsystem.library included. Please use
  that if you have a ppc accelerator card.
- flood fill algorithm replaced by a faster version which leads to faster icon
  redrawing in certain cases

41.13 (r69b archive)

- If AllocBitMap()/graphics is called with the SPECIALFMT flag set, it now
  uses the exact depth instead of using the supplied depth parameter.
  Calling AllocBitMap() with the wrong depth for a certain pixel format
  could lead to all kinds of problems with older versions.
- the 040 version of cgxsystem.library now correctly checks for the
  availability of a 68040 CPU and fails to load if it can't be found
- LockBitmapTagList()/cybergraphics now works properly if a certain tag occurs
  multiple times
- Fixed some weird clipping problems in 15/16/24 bit modes that were likely to
  appear when there was memory installed in ZorroII address space (e.g. ZII
  memory cards or A2000 turbo cards).

41.12 (r69 archive)
- library recompiled with SAS/C 6.58 and global optimizer enabled
- fixed a BltBitmap()/graphics patch bug for Hi/True color bitmaps. The
  expansion code for a single plane did not work properly which caused
  problems with DiskSalv's startup window for example.
- fixed some screen open problems with programs like Digita's Organizer
- added 2 new LVOs to cgxsystem.library that handle communication with CGXMode
- modified the patch system to avoid trouble with MCP style hacks
- fixed a bug in the patterned line drawing code for hi/truecolor bitmaps
- another "SUPER" production has made it into CyberGraphX 3.
  This time its SUPERGELS, a replacement for the original CyberGraphX GELs
  system. It is disabled by default, you have to set
  envarc:cybergraphx/SUPERGELS to "1" to enable it. 
  Make sure you have no tools like PatchControl running in front of the
  monitor startup. To allow SuperGels to work, you need to run it after
  the monitor startup.
- added a new kludge to fix the ViewByName problems in hi/true color modes.
- added new code to speedup standard wb pattern backfills. Probably interferes
  with hacks like FastIPrefs. Please make sure to disable this kind of tools
  if you experience any problems.
- fixed a bug in BltMaskBitMapRastPort()/graphics patch. If you used a 
  interleaved planar bitmap as source the mask modulo was not calculated
  the way the original graphics.library function did it.
 
 ADDITIONAL NOTE: Please make sure you put hacks like MCP AFTER the
 CyberGraphX system is started into the startup-sequence. Otherwise MCP might
 cause trouble. Don't install ObtainGIRPort related patches because they can
 lead to semaphore deadlocks under certain conditions

41.11 (r68 archive)
- CyberGraphX now respects the setting of the autoscroll flag in the
  screenmode prefs program. WB screens always had autoscrolling enabled
  before.
- minor speedup for JAM2 cpu drawing mode of BltTemplate()/graphics
  in hicolor modes
- BltTemplate()/graphics calls with mask=0x00 in hi/truecolor modes are
  terminated early now
- inverse video JAM1 cpu drawing mode of BltTemplate()/graphics should now
  work properly for hicolour modes
- fixed a bug in BltBitmap()/graphics patch, FillPixelArray()/cybergraphics
  and InvertPixelArray()/cybergraphics
  Relocaled hi/truecolour video maps are rendered at the correct offset now.
- revised the CyberGraphX GELs system.
- fixed a severe, long outstanding bug in the DragGList()/graphics patch
  that bobs which had the BOBSAWAY flag set were never removed from the 
  GELs list.

41.10 (r67 archive)
- pointer colours are now restored properly if you activate a next screen
  and reactivate the frontmost screen again after that. (only happened when
  frontmost screen was in high/true colour)
- added new env switch USESEMAPHORES which lets CyberGraphX use Semaphores
  to avoid disabling of multitasking under certain conditions.
  The value of this variable is only checked at boot time.
  Enabling this option may lead to lockups under certain conditions but is
  more system friendly in general because multitasking is not disabled during
  certain drawing operations.
- removed some obsolete ExecBase/4.L accesses that could slow down graphics
  operations if cyberguard/enforcer like tools were enabled

41.9 (r66 archive)
- fixed a bug in the WriteLUTPixelArray()/cybergraphics call

41.8 (r65 archive)
- added new LVO to cybergraphics.library to write chunky pixel arrays with custom
  colormaps to truecolour screens
- new LVO added to cgxsystem.library to give applications access to the list of
  installed graphics devices
- if a OpenScreenTags()/intuition tag SA_ColorMapEntries is detected with
  a data value greater 256 it is limited to 256. This fixes some problems with
  truecolour screens in conjunction with certain applications (e.g. gmultiview)
  that are always trying to get 1 depth entries.
- BltBitmap()/graphics calls with mask=0x00 are never passed to the gfx
  card drivers anymore.
- You can now click "through" transparent regions of a layer
- Fixed a bug in the HideWindow()/cgxsystem.library call
- If SUPERLAYERS is activated can be checked by searching for the public
  semaphore "SLayerSemaphore" now

41.7 (r64 archive)
- new LVOs added to cgxsystem.library to allow for easy support of window
  iconification. Windows can be hidden by a simple call now (SUPERLAYERS only)
- added new LVOs to cgxsystem.library to let applications support transparent
  regions inside layers (SUPERLAYERS only)
- DoCDrawMethodTagList()/cybergraphics did not work at all actually because
  the supplied hook was never called. Fixed.
- mouse pointer hotspot changes due to modification of the HIRESCRSR env
  variable take now effect immediately.
- all aga sprite resolution related mouse pointer hotspot problems should
  be fixed now (e.g. PageStream3/Iconian cross hair)
- CModeRequestTagList()/cybergraphics.library now correctly returns a 0
  instead of -1L/INVALID_ID if the mode requester is canceled
- fixed a serious problem with screen dragging in conjunction with updating of
  next screens. If the front screen was dragged down while there was something
  updated in the background the system could crash.
- blitting of LUT8 format src bitmaps to rgb destinations maps crashed
  immediately. Fixed.
- BestCModeIDTagList()/cybergraphics now always returns the displayid of the 
  first graphics board available of that kind if the CYBRBIDTG_MonitorID tag
  is specified. If multiple boards of the same kind were installed, it always
  returned the last board available in most cases before.


41.6 (r63 archive)
- SUPERLAYERS could return 0 with some NO-OP layer operations. Now intuition 
  requesters should work properly.
- Layer damage code in SUPERLAYERS ScrollRaster patch rewritten
  Now every exotic situations should be handled properly.
- Discovered that some code "out there" relies on a private field in
  layer structure, which was changed with SUPERLAYERS. The old field
  is now supported and this causes for example MUI complex 
  virtual groups to scroll more smoothly.
- ScalePixelArray()/cybergraphics now uses the blitter for line replication
  in source mode RECTFMT_LUT8 and RECTFMT_ARGB whenever possible.
- fixed a bug in DoCDrawMethodTagList()/cybergraphics. The supplied hook was
  always called with the parampacket and the object swapped.

41.5 (r62 archive)
- fixed a memory leak problem in the color extraction code for
  Flood()/graphics operations. A certain buffer was not freed.
- extracting certain pens on planar rastports didn't work at all for
  Flood()/graphics operations. Now fixed.

41.4 (r60 archive)
- fixed a bug with computation of free video memory in OpenScreenTagList()
  patch

41.3 (r59 archive)
- bumped revision to 41.3
- modifed graphics.library color function patches, to avoid possible problems
  on systems with multiple graphics boards installed.
- modified CVideoCtrlTagList()/cybergraphics to avoid possible problems in a 
  multi monitor system.
- CVideoCtrlTagList()/cybergraphics waits for the vertical blank period now
  until it applies the given tags to the viewport

41.2 beta6 (r58 archive)
- Complement draw WritePixel()/graphics now correctly works under rgb
  colour screens. This fixes e.g. some problems with the various circle
  tools of ImageFX/Photogenics/PageStream3.1 etc. when used with screens
  that have more than 256 colours.

41.2 beta5 (r57 archive)
- fixed a problem with the mousepointer moving to fast. This problem
  was introduced with cgxsystem.library 41.2 beta4
- WaitBOVP() and AllocDBufInfo() graphics patches were accidentally
  removed in cgxsystem.library 41.2 beta4. fixed

41.2 beta4 (r55 archive)
- fixed the "mouse pointer can't be moved beyond position 1363 in
  x direction" problem
- modified CoerceMode()/graphics patch to return the real viewport
  display id instead of the base monitor id in case of a cybergraphx
  mode
- added some new lvo's to cybergraphics.library for CyberGL
- fixed some problems in the view related code that should cure
  some trouble with native amiga modes used like in ScalaMM or
  ProDad's SSA Player.
- fixed a bug in the RGB24 3BPP cpu masked pattern blit code
- fixed a bug in the RGB15PC fmt writepixel code (used by PII)
- optimized cpu bitblit code for 3BPP rectangle copies
- added a new call to the cybergraphics.library interface
- optimized cpu filling code for 3BPP rectfills
- fixed a bug in the RGB24 3BPP line drawing code

41.2 beta3 (r54 archive)
- Scrolling of superbitmap layers speeded up a lot with Superlayers
  enabled. Now uses the blitter whereever possible.

41.2 beta2 (r53 archive)
- Fixed a D2 data register trashing problem with BltBitmap()/graphics
  0xc0 minterms on truecolour bitmaps.
- added support for superbitmaps in Superlayers and fixed some damage
  region related bug in Scrollraster()/graphics patch
- fixed conversion bug with RGBA/ARGB scaling in ScalePixelArray()/cgx
  when destination bitmap format was RGB15

41.2 beta1 (r52 archive)
- Superlayers now support smartrefresh in all weird clipping and damage
  cases.

41.2 (r51 archive)
-  added  new  layers  replacement.   Should  speed  layers  up  a  lot,
   especially wh/en sizing layers.  It is disabled by default, you have to
   set envarc:cybergraphx/SUPERLAYERS to "1" to enable it.  At the moment
   this superlayers is in beta-state, and some work still has to be done.
   SuperBitMap layers and custom clipping to offscreen smartrefresh buffers
   are not done yet.  So use this BETA-OPTION at your own risk, and if it
   doesn't work, disable it and wait for later releases.

41.1 beta9 (r50 archive)
- graphics/BitMapScale() now also supports scaling of chunky,hicolour and
  truecolour bitmaps. It only worked for planar destinations before.

41.1 beta8 (r49 archive)
- internal changes in MovePixelArray()/cybergraphics. Should now work
  with layered RastPorts, too.
- added optimized code for drawing circles in hi/true colour modes
- increased writepixel output speed for  hi/true colour modes.

41.1 beta7 (b47 archive)
- flood fills are a bit faster for planar bitmaps now. This should improve
  performance for certain flood fill operations on workbench icons.

41.1 beta6 (b46 archive)
- improved speed auf RECTFMT_LUT8 WritePixelArray()/cybergraphics call
  on 15/16 bit rgb colour screens. Apps like Frodo4.0 which use
  WritePixelArray/RECTFMT_LUT8 may gain a litte speed due to the
  optimized call. Stack usage increases though.
- BitMapScale()/graphics patch trashed 68k data register D7 in some cases.
  This is now fixed.

41.1 beta5 (b45 archive)
- improved speed auf RECTFMT_LUT8 WritePixelArray()/cybergraphics call
  on 8 bit screens. It should be as fast as WritePixelArray8()/graphics
  patch now. Apps or games which have cybergraphx support and use
  WritePixelArray/RECTFMT_LUT8 instead of WritePixelArray8 may gain a
  litte speed due to the optimized call.

41.1 beta4 (b44 archive)
- fixed "test screen to small" problem introduced with beta2

41.1 beta3 (b43 archive)
- added some code to get powersnap working on truecolour screens

41.1 beta2 (b42 archive)
- added additional planar bitmap checks in BltBitmap()/graphics code
  to avoid some strange effects with certain programs

41.1 (b41 archive)
- LockBitMapTagList()/cgx always returned a 0 as handle. Now it returns the
  handle properly.
  This will most likely fix all AmiWin related lockups. 

362 (b40 archive)
- added support for multiple boards of the same kind. The drivers need to
  have that feature implemented though to use that option.
- fixed some problems with standard menu backfilling when PLANES2FAST option
  is enabled. Please don't use that option when you are not aware of what it's
  doing actually. It reduces compatibility and general stability in some cases.

346 (b39 archive)
- inlined some code in cgxsystem.library. This will slightly improve speed
  in some areas

320 (b37 archive)
- added horizontal/vertical lines hw acceleration for gfx boards
  that don't have a special line engine but allow for solid fill.

299 (b35 archive)
- Due to a bug in the rect filling code, swapping/toggling of simple refresh
  windows got really slow unter truecolour screens with v2 and previous
  V3 versions. There is really a VISIBLE speed INCREASE with that fixed now
  when using simple refresh windows.

291 (b34 archive)
- nextscreens should get updated properly now

289 (b33 archive)
- This is for all WritePixel/PutPixels lovers out there:
  wasted 20 minutes of my valueable time to increase writepixel output. This
  graphics function is mostly unused with os graphics operation but some people
  really think that the speed of this function is a general speed indicator
  Rather strange ......
- fixed a bug in OpenScreen()/intuition patch. If applications called it with
  other flags besides NS_EXTENDED set in the newscreen.type field, the 
  Extended tag field was ignored. This e.g. fixes some screen opening problems
  with Finalwriter.
- programs which use the SA_LikeWorkbench tag to open a screen correctly open 
  on a cybergraphx display now, if the workbench is opened on a cybergraphx
  display, too.

<A NAME="cgxvid"></A>
<H2><B>cgxvideo.library changes</B></H2>
------------------------------------------------------------------
41.10 (r69 archive)
- removed all CVision3D hardware dependencies. Instead it uses a generic CGX3
  driver VStream API now. Make sure you have the latest drivers installed when
  you use this library.
- added support for GIMMEZEROZERO window

41.8 (r67 archive)
- minor internal changes 

41.7 (r64 archive)
- added new source types SRCFMT_RGB15 and SRCFMT_RGB16 to allow for rgb
  color space overlays

41.6 (r63 archive)
- added new tag VOA_UseBackFill to allow for automatic backfill of simple
  refresh layers when the color keying option is used.

41.5 (r58 archive)
- cgxvideo.library does not allow to create overlay on interlace screens
  anymore
- Fixed problem with wrong mousepointer colours when overlay was enabled.
  This fix requires at least CVision3D driver V2.2
- fixed a bug with 15/16/24 bit opaque overlays
- added color keying support.
- New tag VOA_UseColorKey for CreateVLayerHandleTags() call added
- New tags VOA_ColorKeyPen and VOA_ColorKey for GetVLayerAttr() call
  added

41.4 (b55 archive)
- video layer area is cleared now when CreateVLayerHandleTagList() is 
  called
- It is unable to open cgxvideo.library now, if no graphics board with
  video overlay capatibilities could be found.

41.3 (b53 archive)
- horizontal filter characteristics are set now depending on the scale
  factor.
- added support for overlays on high/truecolour screens

41.2 (b47 archive)
- removed some obsolete debug output in ChangeWindowBox()/intuition patch

41.1 (b41 archive)
- bumped rev to 41.1 

99 (b39 archive)
- should now work with z2 kind of boards


<A NAME="cgxboot"></A>
<H2><B>cgxbootpic.library changes</B></H2>
------------------------------------------------------------------
41.7 (r69 archive)
- fixed a mismatched free mem size in image decoder

41.6 (r58 archive)
- library now correctly supports library expunge which safes some memory
  after system boot.

41.5 (r56 archive)
- initial public release


<A NAME="cv64"></A>
<H2><B>CV64 driver changes</B></H2>
------------------------------------------------------------------
2.10 (r70a archive)
- The driver added an additional, faulty screenmode to the mode list in some
  weird cases. Now fixed
- Fixed an illegal memory access in the acceleration code for patterned mask
  fills (e.g. used by colorwheel gadget)
- If the BOOTLOGO is enabled the driver now automatically switches to Amiga
  video again after the logo is displayed for 8 seconds (requires that CV64
  VGA input is connected to amiga video output of course). You had to use
  LAMIGA-m after 8 seconds manually before to switch to the amiga video.
- added support for boundary aligned video maps in DRAGGING=OFF mode 
  (e.g. required by Fusion). Requires at least cgxsystem.library 41.19

2.9 (r69f archive)
- modified MOVE16 bitmap swap in/out code to workaround a bug in certain
  040 accelerator cards.
- fixed a potential race condition when an interrupt occured, the int handler
  was already installed but the hardware was not initialized completely.
- (YES|NO) is also accepted for the BOOTLOGO tooltype now instead of (1|0)
- reenabled roxxler support. There is now an additional tooltype
  USEROXXLER=(YES|NO) to disable roxxler manually. Default is enabled.

2.8 (r69e archive)
- added os3 style doublebuffer support. Only works with dragging disabled
  (tooltype DRAGGING=NO), otherwise any attempt to allocate a dbufinfo will
  fail. Requires at least cgxsystem.library 41.16

2.7 (r69c archive)
- the driver does not crash with divide by zero anymore at startup if modes
  with pixelfrequencies less than 12.5 mhz or higher than 135mhz are loaded

2.6 (r69 archive)
- added bitblit acceleration for some occasionally used minterms
- added 2 new driver calls
- fixed a problem in the bitmap swap code for interleaved bitmaps <= 16 cols
- the memory management code now uses a first in/first out mechanism for
  bitmaps
- fixed a bug in the memory management code that only occured while mungwall
  was running
- driver recompiled with SAS/C 6.58 and global optimizer enabled
- modified init code to workaround a bug of certain boards (int level is set
  to 6 although it is programmed to 2 which could lead to lockups at startup).
- fixed a bug in patterned masked fill acceleration code for rgb screens
  that was introduced in 2.5 (fixes a problem with colorwheel on rgb screens)

2.5 (r68 archive)
- WaitBOVP does not cpu-poll the vblank state anymore to wait for the
  vertical blank phase.
- Added new tooltype DRAGGING=(YES|NO). If dragging is disabled it is 
  possible to keep multiple screens in video memory. 
- added tooltype "SCROLLMASK=(YES|NO) which disables/enables
  masking when scrolling/moving rectangles with a mask in 256 colour
  modes (e.g. scrolling text in shell windows).
  If you disable masking by specifying "NO", scrolling of e.g. shell text
  gets faster in 256 colours, you get some text crsr refresh problems with
  e.g. CygnusED (up to v3.5) though.
  Default setting for the SCROLLMASK option is "YES".
  ADDITIONAL NOTE: NEVER rename the CVision64.info file. The tooltype
  parsing does not work if it has a different name.
- fixed a derefenced pointer problem in the screen dragging code when empty
  areas were cleared (could lead to enforcer hits)

2.4 (r64 archive)
- modified driver startup code, needs at least cgxsystem.library 41.7
  now
- Fixed a serious bug in the startup code which could have caused various
  trouble in certain situations at driver startup

2.3 (r60 archive)
- DPMS support code now sets HSYNC/VSYNC to logic 0 instead of logic 1
- fixed a small problem that the colors were not changed when a
  nextscreen was activated. (Introduced due to changes in 2.2/r59)

2.2 (r59 archive)
- The code to display interlace views was partly wrong since the very
  beginning  of this driver (even for v2).
  It quite often worked for 8bit views but it most often failed for
  16/24bit displays. This should be fixed now.
- added support for cybergraphics.library v2 style DPMS PowerManagement
  again
- modified some lvo's to support modified color setting functions in
  cgxsystem.library


2.1 beta2 (b55 archive)
- fixed a bug in the h/w accelerated software crsr clipping code
- the boot picture decoding is now handled by an external library
  called cgxbootpic.library.

2.1 (b53 archive)
- bumped rev to 2.1
- enabled 2d polygon engine for 15/16/24 bit resolutions. This
  increases speed for areafills in rgb colour modes.
- software mouse pointer is now generated by the graphics engine.
  This will give a smoother moving pointer and will reduce cpu
  load when the pointer is moved.

beta 504 (b43 archive)
- added tooltype "PASSTHROUGH=(YES|NO) which disables/enables
  monitor switch.

beta 499 (b42 archive)
- fixed rgb colour template blits bug in conjunction with
  INVERSEVID drawmode

492 (b40 archive)
- added support for multiple CV64s in one machine. All installed
  CV64s share the same config right now. The first CV64 board
  will keep the known screenmode names (CVision: xBit ..). All
  subsequent boards will get the board number added to the
  screen mode base name (CVision.2: xBit .. etc.) and modified
  display IDs
- removed roxxler p2c conversion support for this beta release
  needs to be reviewed. The alternative hardware p2c conversion
  method is still enabled though.

443 (b39 archive)
- minor changes for latest cgxsystem.library

beta 441 (b37 archive)
- fixed refresh problems for screens that were moved horizontally
  (screens that are smaller than the visible width and centered
  to the viewport are updated properly now)
- device name is now "CVision64" instead "CyberVision"
- added code to support hardware planar 2 chunky blits
- enabled roxxler support code for p2c conversion

beta 398 (b34 archive)
- added wb tooltype support
  the env variable cybergraphx/bootlogo has now become a tooltype
  added tooltype MEMCLOCK=xx to modify default memory clock
- software crsr should now work as expected even on nextscreens
- added support for cgxmode hidden flag
- added a workaround for the save config bug in cgxmode

beta 369 (b33 archive)
- fixed a problem with swaps of 2 colour screens. if the screen was
  swapped in the whole display was erased.

beta
- mouse pointer colours are set correct now when a new view is
  opened

<A NAME="cv3d"></A>
<H2><B>CV3D driver changes</B></H2>
------------------------------------------------------------------
2.16beta3
- modified driver init code to fix some problems at startup
- Due to a SAS/C optimizer bug, the init code did a byte write to a 
  derefenced address which is probably the reason that the latest CVision3D
  driver did not work for many people.

2.16 (r70a archive)
- The driver added an additional, faulty screenmode to the mode list in some
  weird cases. Now fixed
- If the BOOTLOGO is enabled the driver now automatically switches to Amiga
  video again after the logo is displayed for 8 seconds (of course requires 
  cv3d scandoubler output). You had to use LAMIGA-m after 8 seconds manually
  before to switch to the amiga video.
- added support for boundary aligned video maps in DRAGGING=OFF mode 
  (e.g. required by Fusion). Requires at least cgxsystem.library 41.19

2.15 (r69f archive)
- modified MOVE16 bitmap swap in/out code to workaround a bug in certain
  040 accelerator cards
- fixed a potential race condition when an interrupt occured, the int handler
  was already installed but the hardware was not initialized completely.
- reenables draggable screens again that were accidentally disabled in 2.14
  even if tooltype DRAGGING was set to "YES"
- fixed a bug in the PLL table code introduced in r67 (v2.10). display modes
  that were defined with a pixelclock > 121MHz always used a maximum pixelclock
  of 121MHz really
- (YES|NO) is also accepted for the BOOTLOGO tooltype now instead of (1|0)

2.14 (r69e archive)
- added os3 style doublebuffer support. Only works with dragging disabled
  (tooltype DRAGGING=NO), otherwise any attempt to allocate a dbufinfo will
  fail. Requires at least cgxsystem.library 41.16
- Overlay in 15bit rgb modes enabled RGB16 for the primary stream. Now the
  colours are correct for 15bit overlay screens

2.13 (r69c archive)
- added new tooltype called MULTIMEDIAMEM=(YES|NO) which enables/disables
  the multimedia extensions like video overlay and 3d. If disabled, extension
  memory is used as extra video memory for amiga bitmaps/screens.

2.12 (r69 archive)
- added bitblit acceleration for some occasionally used minterms
- added support for generic CGX3 driver video stream API. cgxvideo.library 41.10
  uses the new interface.
- removed an obsolete debug output that could appear with a certain interrupt
  state
- added 2 new driver calls
- fixed a problem in the bitmap swap code for interleaved bitmaps <= 16 cols
- The version string of the driver now gives info on the zorro version it
  is compiled for instead of the cpu version
- the memory management code now uses a first in/first out mechanism for
  bitmaps
- fixed a bug in the memory management code that only occured while mungwall
  was running
- driver recompiled with SAS/C 6.58 and global optimizer enabled (only for Z3
  version)

2.11 (r68 archive)
- WaitBOVP does not cpu-poll the vblank state anymore to wait for the
  vertical blank phase 
- The driver adds a resource called cv3dscenic.resource to the system now
  to grant applications access to the external scenic/mx2 addon module
- fixed a derefenced pointer problem in the screen dragging code when empty
  areas were cleared (could lead to enforcer hits)
- Added new tooltype DRAGGING=(YES|NO). If dragging is disabled it is 
  possible to keep multiple screens in video memory. 
  Due to a redesign of some driver internals cgxvideo.library up to version
  1.8 and cgx3dvirgin.library up to version 1.5 don't work anymore if
  dragging is disabled. This will be fixed in a forthcoming release.

2.10 (r67 archive)
- the blitter is used now to save/restore the software crsr background
  in double clocked 8bit modes (>100Mhz)
- switching from a high/true color screen to a double clocked (>100MHz)
  8bit screen should work without problems now
- The CV3D driver uses a modified PLL table now. This fixes some display
  clock problems with certain cards

2.9 (r65 archive)
- optimized size of Z2 driver
- blits with mask=0 are now handled correctly. This solves some problems with
  certain mui application that use certain ScrollRaster()/graphics tricks.
- Offset bug in the line drawing code fixed.
- Fixed a offset bug in the triangle areafill code.

2.8 (r64 archive)
- Fixed a serious bug in the startup code which could have caused various
  trouble in certain situations at driver startup
- modified driver startup code, needs at least cgxsystem.library 41.7
  now

2.7 (r63 archive)
- multiple CV64/3D boards now correctly get a different basename.
  All boards following the first one will get the board number added
  to the screen mode base name (CV64/3D.2: xBit .. etc.)

2.6 (r62 archive)
- Z2 pointer image bug fixed. (introduced with r60)

2.5 (r61 archive)
- added tooltype "SCROLLMASK=(YES|NO) which disables/enables
  masking when scrolling/moving rectangles with a mask 256 colour
  modes (e.g. scrolling text in shell windows).
  If you disable masking by specifying "NO", scrolling of e.g. shell text
  gets faster in 256 colours, you get some text crsr refresh problems with
  e.g. CygnusED though.
  Default setting for the SCROLLMASK option is "YES".
  ADDITIONAL NOTE: NEVER rename the CVision3D.info file. The tooltype
  parsing does not work if it has a different name.
- added some special code for 24bit resolutions greater/equal 1024 pixel
  width. It now uses the blitter for rectfills and moving rectangles in
  these modes

2.4 (r60 archive)
- Changed maximum raster size to 2048x1536 to allow definition of
  1024x768 24bit views. It is not recommended to use a pixelwidth
  of 1024 in these modes though, because the blitter only works in
  resolutions up to 1016 pixel width in 24bit modes. Define a 1016
  pixel width viewmode instead.
- modified hardware crsr code to allow a max resolution of 1024x768
  24bit resolution with 3MB video ram even.
- DPMS support code now sets HSYNC/VSYNC to logic 0 instead of logic 1

2.3 (r59 archive)
- The code to display interlace views was partly wrong since the very
  beginning of this v3 driver.
  It quite often worked for 8bit views but it most often failed for
  16/24bit displays. This should be fixed now.
- added support for cybergraphics.library v2 style DPMS PowerManagement
  again
- modified some lvo's to support modified color setting functions in
  cgxsystem.library

2.2 (r58 archive)
- fixed some problems with wrong mouse pointer colours when overlay is 
  enabled.

2.1 beta 6 (b55 archive)
- the boot picture decoding is now handled by an external library
  called cgxbootpic.library.

2.1 beta 5 (b48 archive)
- modified board init code to fix some z2 related init problems

2.1 beta 3 (b43 archive)
- bootlogo is visible now if scandoubler output is used
- added tooltype "PASSTHROUGH=(YES|NO) which disables/enables
  monitor switch.

2.1 beta 2 (b42 archive)
- added support for multiple CV3Ds in one machine. All installed
  CV3Ds share the same config right now. The first CV3D board
  will keep the known screenmode names (CV64/3D: xBit ..). All
  subsequent boards will get the board number added to the
  screen mode base name (CV64/3D.2: xBit .. etc.) and modified
  display IDs

2.1 (b41 archive)
- bumped rev to 2.1

1049 (b40 archive)
- minor internal changes

1045 (b39 archive)
- minor changes for latest cgxsystem.library

beta 1043 (b37 archive)
- fixed refresh problems for screens that were moved horizontally
  (screens that are smaller than the visible width and centered
  to the viewport are updated properly now)

beta 1027 (b35 archive)
- added support for masked bitblits. This improves compatibility to
  programs like CygnusEd in 8 bit (no text crsr trouble anymore when
  scrolling) but  - as a drawback - reduces speed of standard
  shell scrolling 

beta 1023 (b34 archive)
- added wb tooltype support
  the env variable cybergraphx/bootlogo has now become a tooltype
- software crsr should now work as expected even on nextscreens
- added a workaround for the save config bug in cgxmode

beta 1007 (b33 archive)
- fixed a problem with swaps of 2 colour screens. if the screen was
  swapped in the whole display was erased.


<A NAME="cvppc"></A>
<H2><B>CVPPC driver changes</B></H2>
------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7
- "CyberGraphX style" double/triple buffering using vport scrolling on a single
  bitmap didn't  work at all. This should be fixed now.
- reworked the complete vblank handler since it did not work as expected. OS3
  style double buffering should work properly now and dbuf messages should be
  send properly sync'ed with the frame rate.
- modified driver init code to fix some problems at startup
- interlace modes are now automatically filtered when loaded because
  CVisionPPC does not support interlace resolutions
- (hopefully) fixed some scrolling bugs introduced in 2.6
- the driver now limits the cgxmode pixelclock maximum to 100mhz in 32bit mode
  and to 145mhz in 24 bit packed pixel mode

2.6
- fixed autoscroll bug in 16/24/32bit modes
- added tooltype BITMAPCACHE=(YES|NO) to enable/disable caching of  bitmaps. Defaults to YES.
- added support for caching of displayable friend bitmaps e.g. smart refresh
  layer bitmaps. This should speed up refresh of obscured smart refresh layers.
  Requires at least cgxsystem.library 41.20
- added tooltype PACKED24=(YES|NO) to enable packed pixel mode
  for 24bit resolutions. This allows higher refresh rates and
  requires less memory. As a drawback, some accelerated
  graphics operations and cpu rendering slows down. The tooltype
  defaults to NO.
- added support for 1280x1024x32bit resolution with 8mb cards
- added acceleration support for non visible bitmaps
- added support for accelerated pattern fills
- added support for accelerated solid mask fills

2.5
- initial release


<A NAME="cl"></A>
<H2><B>Cirrus Logic drivers</B></H2>
------------------------------------------------------------------
2.7 (r70a archive)
- The driver added an additional, faulty screenmode to the mode list in some
  weird cases. Now fixed
- added support for boundary aligned video maps in DRAGGING=OFF mode 
  (e.g. required by Fusion). Requires at least cgxsystem.library 41.19
- The PicassoIV driver does not try to enable the flickerfixer anymore
  if the tooltype PASSTHROUGH is set to NO

2.6 (r69f archive)
- modified MOVE16 bitmap swap in/out code to workaround a bug in certain
  040 accelerator cards.
- reenabled DPMS support functionality for PicassoII,Spectrum,PiccoloZ2/Z3
  cards egain
- PiccoSD64/Piccolo 15/16bit<->8bit format conversions were incorrect for
  dragged screens. Fixed
- (YES|NO) is also accepted for the BOOTLOGO tooltype now instead of (1|0)
- fixed some PIV flickerfixer related problems
- KNOWN PROBLEMS: With CGX3, some PicassoII users reported strange "fuzzy" pixel
  problems when displaying fonts on 15/16 bit screens. Since this only happens
  on certain cards, its very hard to reproduce and to track down. We hope to
  fix it in a future release.

2.5 (r69e archive)
- added os3 style doublebuffer support. Only works with dragging disabled
  (tooltype DRAGGING=NO), otherwise any attempt to allocate a dbufinfo will
  fail. Requires at least cgxsystem.library 41.16
- added real vblank int support for PicassoIV (needs at least p4resource v2)
- bootlogo should show up now if enabled for Spectrum/PicassoII(+)/Piccolo
  cards
- PASSTHROUGH tooltype now works for Spectrum/PicassoII(+)/Piccolo cards
- hopefully fixed remaining masking problems for template blits in 8bit
  modes with PicassoII(+)/Spectrum/Piccolo cards (e.g. FinalWriter toolbar
  was displayed wrong in 2-128 colours)
- ADDITIONAL NOTE: Starting with r69e a PicassoIV driver is included although
  it was originally planned to be released with the r70 archive. This driver
  is not 100% in some respects although it should work ok for most stuff. It
  has been included to show that this driver is neither a hoax, nor that it is
  "phase5 tactics" to delay the driver and release r69a-zz archives until r70
  is out. Keep in mind that CGX3 is a freebie and so is the PIV driver.
  Development of the driver has been and is actually in no way supported by
  VillageTronic. If you don't feel comfortable with the driver, don't use it.
  Bug reports are appreciated nevertheless.

2.4 (r69 archive)
- init code now correctly initializes the DrvrName field in the GraphDev
  structure
- vga switch did not switch into passthrough mode when control was given
  over to another graphics card installed into the system. Now fixed.
- disabled DPMS functionality for PicassoII,Spectrum,Piccolo Z2/Z3 because
  this cards don't support DPMS really.
- fixed 24bit modes software cursor invisible bug when screen dragging was
  disabled
- 24bit modes for Cirrus GD5446 cards work now. It seems that the 32bit
  Mac alike modes don't work due to a Cirrus hardware bug.
- The CGXMode hidden mode flag is now supported by the driver
- added 2 new driver calls
- fixed a problem in the dragging code
- added DRAGGING=(YES|NO) tooltype
- the display is blanked now if a new view is loaded
- added PicassoIV support

ADDITIONAL NOTE: Beginning with the PicassoII driver in release 68 people
 reported strange problems. Some people had distorted fonts in 16bit, some
 only had 2/3 of the screen displayed horizontally and some missed complete
 menu strips. Actually only a few people reported that, so we assume that
 it only happens with certain PicassoII cards. As we don't know how to fix
 that problem (it works fine with the PicassoII we have) we need your help.
 If you experience such problems, please mail some more detailed information
 (PicassoII board revision, chip id revision, os version, resolution used
  etc.) to cybergfx.bugs@vgr.com so that the problem can hopefully be fixed
 in a forthcoming release.

2.3 (r68 archive)
- fixed a bug in JAM1 pattern fill code for 8bit modes (e.g. fixes crashes
  with reqtools dir requester)
- fixed a derefenced pointer problem in the screen dragging code when empty
  areas were cleared (could lead to enforcer hits)
- inverse solid fills now work properly in 24bit modes (only relevant for
  PiccoSD64 driver)
- fixed bug in pattern fill and masked patterned fill code for 16/24 bit
  modes. (only happened for GD5426 cards like Spectrum/Piccolo/PicassoII)
- fixed a bug in the screen dragging code when a 8bit screen was in front
  and a 16bit screen behind (crashed for Spectrum and Piccolo cards)

2.2
- added support for accelerated solid mask fills
- fixed pattern fill rendering bug in both LUT and RGB modes.

- bumped catalog version to 7, old catalogs need to be updated
- modified test mode mechanism. Does not rely on file notification anymore but
  uses a direct driver interface now. Requires the latest monitor drivers and
  cgxsystem.library to be installed
- added PicassoIV graphics card to list of supported cards.

2.3 (r66 archive)
- added Inferno graphics card for DKB Wildfire to list of supported card.

2.1 (b55 archive)
- added cgxmode.ct and cgxmode.cd to distribution for people who want to do their
  own locale translations
- the "modes are gone after reboot problem" is hopefully gone now
- the hidden status of modes is now displayed in the info box in the main window
- default name for PicassoII card is now "PicassoII" instead of "Picasso"
- changed test image design on test screen
