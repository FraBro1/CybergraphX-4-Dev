	@{u}Introduction@{uu}

		The CyberGraphX system was designed to define an independant graphics
	standard for graphics boards. We also wanted to continue our development
	of workbench emulations. We could include all our knowledge of about 5 years
	of graphics board software development (wb-emulation of Visiona, Domino,
	PicassoII, CyberVision64, CyberVision64/3D and now the CyberVisionPPC).
	CyberGraphX is based on hardware dependant monitor drivers and hardware
	independant libraries. This has some advantages: Bug fixes in the workbench
	emulation or speed optimizations is of benefit for ALL gfx boards that are
	supported by the CyberGraphX system.
	CyberGraphX allows using of 15/16/24 screens independant of the used
	color model. You are able to use the cybergraphics.library functions to
	modify this screens. Using graphics.library functions is currently not
	possible but this may change in one of the next releases.

	CyberGraphX is also the standard graphics extension of all graphics boards
	by phase5 digital products. (of course including drivers for diverse graphics
	programs, screen promoters and much more).


	@{b}FEATURES@{ub}

	o stable Workbench emulation;
	o dragable screens for graphics cards that can support it
	o no chipmem required for screen display
	o modular design, it is possible to use multiple (and different) gfx boards
	  at one time

	@{u}Minimum requirements to run CyberGraphX4 @{uu}

	o One of the following boards
		- Picasso II(+) in linear mode (! not segmented !)
		- Picasso IV
		- Piccolo Z2/Z3 or Piccolo SD64
		- GVP Spectrum
		- RetinaZ3
		- Wildfire Inferno
		- CyberVision64
		- CyberVision64/3D
		- CyberVisionPPC
	o Kickstart 3.x
	o 68020 or higher
	o 4 MB of fast memory

	To guarantee work of CyberGraphX4 graphics extension , you have to
	remove the old VillageTronic, EGS emulation, or Picasso96 software.
	This is basically up to yourself. Only if you run CyberGraphX V2 before,
	there is an uninstall script provided on this CD.

	Remove tools like PatchDT or IPrefs2Fast to avoid conflicts.

		The installation is done by the AMIGA Installer. So the only thing you
	have to do is double-click the icon with the name @{b}CGFXV4_Install@{ub} if
	you install CyberGraphX4 for the first time or @{b}CGXV4_Update@{ub} if you
	want to upgrade from a previous V3 installation.

		By setting this variable, DisplayAlert(), (The Screens you get when
	the machine crashes.) will be placed on an cybergraphx screen.

	By setting this variable, you can switch off 15bit modes to reduce "
	screenmode list length. The Modes are still available but hidden.
	This can be done by:

        	setenv cybergraphx/ALERTEMU="1"

	will be done by the CPU (in contrast to the blitter-conversion)
	Therefore the ugly-looking "planar" blitting-effects are gone,
	but the software-conversion is slower.
	The cpu-conversion can be activated by:

        	setenv cybergraphx/CPUP2C="1"

	(this creates the file env:cybergraphx/CPUP2C
	-> you have to copy this file to envarc:cybergraphx/ if

	Picasso-monitor files Hiressprites can be activated by:

		You should read this documentation carefully, so that you have a good
	understanding on how CGXMode works, what number it wants and how it reacts
	with your monitor. It does not get to heavy into tecnobabble as most all the
	other monitor pages do and it is geared around CGXMode and the terms it uses

	ENV:CyberGraphX/PicassoIIMonitor. It will then read the config file that
	is set in ENV:CyberGraphX/PicassoIIMonitor. ENV:CyberGraphX/{board}Monitor,
	where {board} is the basename of the graphics card.

        o  First Time Usage If you are using CGXMode for the first time you NEED to
        find the MAX KHZ value your monitor will support. Once you do this you
        can use the built in DEFAULT values by using the pulldown menus
        (Settings) and selecting the value your monitor supports. Once you do
        this you will see a bunch of default screenmodes that you can customize
        for your personal taste and monitor.

        o  First Time Usage - @{"EDIT" Link "NODE_CGXMODE_MAINWND_MONEDIT"} BUTTON: Pressing this will allow you to enter
        your monitor values. This will let you set the all the MIN and MAX

		To use the Edit Mode window and get the most out of it would be best to understand 
	some of the terms that are used. The problem is that many times there are 4 or 5
	different terms that could mean the same thing. This makes it hard to take your
	monitors information and move it into what CGXMode wants. Below are some terms.
        These terms seem to be used alot for different monitor mfgs and seems to be a good 
	middle ground to match upto CGXMode's terms.
	
	A: Front Porch (Pulse Offset)
        B: Sync Period (Pulse Length)
        C: Back Porch
        D: Blanking Period
        E: Display Period (Resolution)
	A+B+C: (Sync Length)

	You should check to see if ADVANCED tooltype is there before you start
	editing screenmodes if you wish CGXMode to not check for overdriving your
	monitor! See the @{"Tooltype" Link "NODE_CGXMODE_TOOLTYPES"} section.

	@{b}Doublescan@{ub} - Draws every line 2 times. It will draw line 1 then draw line 1
	again.. then move on to line 2 and draw that 2 times and then line 3 etc..
	If you want to use doublescan with a mode that has a horizontal refresh
	frequency of 35khz in normal scan mode, your monitors needs to support

		Horizontal Sync Length (Blanking Period) = Pulse Offset(Front Porch) +
	Pulse Length(Sync Pulse) + (Back Porch). The Sync Length (Blanking Period)
	is the total time that the monitor needs to move the beam from the end of
	one line and to the start of the next. This includes the Front/Back Porches
	that surround the actual Sync Pulse that tells the monitor to move the beam
	to the next frame. Sync Length is use to change the size of the viewing
	area. When the Sync Length is made smaller the Horizontal size of the
	display is increased. This is because you are making the borders smaller
	making more room for more viewable screen area. Reducing the sync length,
	increases horizontal refresh rate and that is limited by the monitor. Just
	the opposite happens when you make the Sync Length larger. You make the 
	borders bigger thus leaving less room for viewable display area. That is 
	why monitors with low horizontal refresh rates often are not that flexible
	when it comes to border sizes. The number is in 탎 (microseconds)

	@{u}Horizontal Pulse Offset@{uu}
	
		Pulse Offset(Front Porch) is the window in time just before the
	the monitor gets the Sync Pulse to tell it to move the beam to the next
	scan line. This can be used to to center the screen. When you change
	the pulse offset you are moving the starting horizontal position of the
	border, thus moving the viewable area with it. Increasing the Pulse Offset
	탎 will move the screen to the left. Decreasing the 탎 will move the

	increasing or decreasing the Pulse Length it just needs to be over the

	monitor probably needs to resync and the scren may move in unpredictable

	@{u}Vertical Sync Length@{uu}

		Vertical Sync Length (Blanking Period) = Pulse Offset(Front Porch)
	+ Pulse Length(Sync Pulse) + (Back Porch). The Sync Length (Blanking
	Period) is the total time that the monitor needs to move the beam from 
	the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen. This includes the 
	Front/Back Porches that surround the actual Sync Pulse that tells the
	monitor to move the beam to the next line. Sync Length is use to change
	the size of the viewing area. When the Sync Length is made smaller the
	vertical size of the display is increased. This is becase you are making
	the borders smaller making more room for more viewable screen area.
	Reducing the sync length, increases vertical refresh rate and that is
	limited by the monitor. Just the opposite happens when you make the 
	Sync Length larger. You make the borders bigger thus leaving less room
	for viewable display area. The number is in ms (milliseconds).

		Pulse Offset(Front Porch) is the window in time just before the

	of the screen from the bottom. This can be used to to center the screen.
	When you change the pulse offset you are moving the starting vertical
	position of the border, thus moving the viewable area with it. Increasing
	the Pulse Offset ms will move the screen up. Decreasing the ms will

	Specification settings the more you can get out of your monitor with CGX. If you

	and you will not get the results you need or want. MAKE SURE you input the

	You will see this everytime you edit your monitors specification:

	In this window you can enter all of your monitors display specifications
