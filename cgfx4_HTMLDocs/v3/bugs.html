 <LI>KNOWN PROBLEMS:
 <UL>
 <LI> Multiple monitor support with 1 gfx card and the amigas built in display, at the same time, does not seem to work?
      Multidisplay from multicards in one machine works very good. Using
      the amigas display with a gfx card at the same time does not work most of
      the time currently. This is known and the author is trying to figure out what is wrong.
      A test with cv3d/p2/p4 in one machine with 3 monitors and all work great..
      each update realtime and function normal. Amiga display on the other hand
      with a gfx card still has problems currently.
 <LI> With CGX3/4, some PicassoII users reported strange "fuzzy" pixel 
      problems when displaying fonts on 15/16 bit screens. Since this only happens 
      on certain cards in certain machines, it's very hard to reproduce and to track down. 
      We hope to fix it in a future release.
 <LI>Some people reported that increasing stack size of the
     initial shell fixes certain boot problems. Try to add a stack command
     in the startup-sequence to check if it fixes anything.
 <LI>There seems to be mount related problem with certain drivers that
     causes some systems to halt at boot time.
     The c:mount command does enforcer hits when there is no tooltype set
     for .info files in devs:dosdrivers. Unfortunately this can lead to a
     total system deadlock in certain cases. The AHI audio driver for example
     does not have ACTIVATE=(0|1) in its .info file and mounting it causes hits
     in most cases.
     Please fix it and check if booting the system works again without problems
     in case of any trouble.
 <LI> If you experience any problems with cgxsystem.library.ppc
      please try the .040 version first to check if it solves your trouble 
      before reporting any bugs.
 <LI>Please make sure you put hacks like MCP AFTER the
     CyberGraphX system is started into the startup-sequence. Otherwise MCP might
     cause trouble. Don't install ObtainGIRPort related patches because they can
     lead to semaphore deadlocks under certain conditions.
