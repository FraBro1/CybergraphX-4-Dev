<H2>CyberVision64/3D - Direct ViRGE 3D Support</H2><P>
If you know of any other programs or demos that use the ViRGE you can email <A href="mailto:vgr@best.com">vgr@best.com</A>
and I will add them here. cgx3dvirgin.library has been cleaned up and is now out.
Making it work correctly with all the new ENVs and manpower where the main reasons for the delay.
Plans to move the 3D function into the monitor driver are still up in the air.

Lib3d is a 3d library used for interfacing 3D hardware or native calls it is made for use in mine/your code and is written in C++ using the SAS compiler,
BUT could easily be transfered to other compilers. Why use lib3D? you may ask, I made this bunch of classes to use in my project if you like them you are
free to use them in yours also. <BR>
<font size=1>
 Its like a wraparound C++ class for 3D-graphics using virgin.library <BR>
 and the virge 3D chip. My intensions is to make this as fast as posible. <BR>
 So i hopes folks out there comes with ideas of improvements Currently <BR>
 Its basicly 3 C++ classes: <BR>
  lib3d - The 3d library  <BR>
  Texture - a texture   <BR>
  DrawVector - a bunch of points and a bunch of info on how to draw triangles out of them  <P>

Using this classes means that you:  <BR>
 - Don't have to setup anything else, they will open the virgin.library, <BR>
   open a screen and then setup the 3d extension for you.  <BR>
 - Don't have to work with complex matrix operands just use <BR>
   Rotate(deg,axisx,axisy,axisZ) eg rotate(1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0) <BR>
   to rotate round x axis or <BR>
 - Translate(deltaX,deltaY,delatZ) to move the objects and <BR>
   Scale(1.0,1.0.2.0) to double the Z size  <BR>

<TD WIDTH=20%><B>IsisPPC</B><P>March 9, 1998</TD>
<TD>Uses the ViRGE overlay video function. <I>From the docs:</I><BR>
<font size=1>
IsisPPC is an MPEG Player for Amiga PPC computers. Some Features:<BR>
 - Starts from Workbench as well as from CLI<BR>
 - Display in 8/15/16/24 Bit on Workbench or any Public-Screen (auto-sensing)<BR>
 - Display in 8/15/16/24 Bit on CyberGraphX-Screens<BR>
 - Usage of the Video-Overlay in combination with the CyberVision64/3D<BR>
 - Control-Panel<BR>
 - Automatic resizing at window size change<BR>
 - VideoCD/CD-I support (using external drivers from BurnIt)<BR>
 - Audio support via AHI V4<BR>
 - Supports MPEG audio layer I-III<BR>
<BR>
  The CyberVision64/3D has a special feature compared to convential graphics cards: the overlay.
  An Overlay is in priciple a rectangular part of the screen, which cannot be hidden by windows
  or other picture elements. To put it in other words: an overlay is always the frontmost element
  in the hierarchy.
  Using the OVERLAY option has the following advantages:
  1) The CPU doesn't have to perform a colour space conversion (the conversion from YUV to RGB data
     is done by the graphics card).
  2) The graphics processor also scales the output. That means that it (virtually) doesn't matter
     if the video is shown in a small window or on the whole screen.
  So, with an overlay, the graphics output speed is increased strongly.
  Unfortunately, by using an overlay some parts of the original Amiga "look and feel" get lost.
  The screen on which an overlay is displayed cannot be dragged anymore. Further, it sometimes looks
  strange if one wants to drag another window on top of the IsisPPC window and the IsisPPC output
  covers that window. But this effect can be eliminated by using the COLORKEY option (other window
  can lay above the IsisPPC window then).

<TD WIDTH=20%><B>CyberPiPView</B><P>February 28, 1998</TD>
<TD>Uses the ViRGE overlay video function. <I>From the docs:</I> 
CyberPiPView is another picture viewer with usage of the
datatypes. This program uses the videolayer feature
of a cv64/3d (currently PIV is not supported)
to display pictures in 16bit no matter which resolution the
current screen has (less than=8bit, 15/16/24bit). This means that
any picture can be shown in up to 65536 colors even if the
current screen just has 8 colors. The gfx processors
automatically scales the picture to fit on the screen.
When the window gets resized, the picture will be scaled, too.
