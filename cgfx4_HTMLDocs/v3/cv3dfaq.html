Q: Does the CV3D work with PPS or GVP 030/040 cards?
A: Yes. The only problem is that in the Amiga 2000 there is
   only 8MB of DMA memory space (autoconfig space). If you have 
   a 040/030 card and it is mapping 8MB of mem inside of the 
   autoconfig space then there is no room for the CV3D to be added in.
   The CV3D uses 4MB of autoconfig space. You must have the 030/040
   card map only 4megs inside the autoconfig space and the rest outside.
   You may also check your other ZorroII cards to see if they
   are also taking any autoconfig space.

Q: Two pixel columns on the right side of the screen are lost and 
   two grey pixel column on the left show up at any resolution 
   when using a pixelclock over 100MHz. 
A: This seems to show up only on a CV64. 
   Not sure of the cause.. might be a bug in the Trio64..
   best thing currently until the proble is cracked down is
   to use a pixelclokc under 100MHz.

Q: Why is the CV64 bus faster then the CV3D 
A: The amiga has only a Zorro3 bus..if you wanna fit PCI chips on it
   (all current gfxchips) you have to make your own bridge... and as 
   Zorro3 has the limit of about 16MB for normal things.. you limited 
   by 16MB too for your PCI bridge...but now the different clocks 
   comes into the play. PCI has a synchron 33Mhz clock...Zorro3 is 
   theoretically asynchron but runs at 25mhz at the moment...
   so you have to sync both sides which will mean a speed loss
   therefore the CV3d has a slower mem interface than the CV64
   (50Mhz local bus Trio) the 3d is lowcost..and was meant to sell 
   cards to people which haven`t bought one yet...including Z2 users.

Q: I installed the CV3D software but the card still does not work.
A: Make sure you have a CyberVision64/3D in the Amiga, not a CyberVision64.
   Thanks to the guys at Nova Design for this one :)

Q: Why does the CV64 use 64MB of autoconfig space?
A: It reduces on board logic such as it needs less logic to decode
   certain addresses, there is enough config space. 

Q: Why does the CV3D use 256MB of autoconfig space in Z3 machines?
A: Because of the PCI address mapping. The next smaller size is 32mb 
   and that is not enough for CV3D. The PCI config setup requires over
   32MB to get access to all registers without additional mapping hardware.
   All registers can be accessed within a 256mb space.

Q: I've put a CV64/3D in an Amiga with a 68040, I noticed that my HD is waiting about
   5 sec without doing nothing. It seems to be SetPatch that is doing the pausing.
A: The 68040 needs to build the mmu table and Zorro3 board address spaces
   are quite huge->more entries in the table->takes longer to create.

Q: Does the ScanDoubler Module for the CV3D, for the A4000, also
   Work in A3000 & A2000?
A: No. The video slot in the A3000/A2000 is different enough that a
   new Modlule will be made. The A2000/A3000 will just have a passthrough,
   there will be a special version of the 'sd' without a video slot interface.
   (As of this time it does not look like this will even be made for the 
   A2000/A3000 owners.)

Q: Does the CV3D have a jummper for setting the card in Z2 mode when it is
   Installed in a Z3 machine?
A: No.

Q: What is the maximum pixel clock for the CV64/3D?
A: The Offical ViRGE manual gives the following numbers: 8bit@135mhz, 
   15/16bit@80mhz and 24bit@50mhz. With CGXMode you can set this higher, 
   but higher rates not supported officially. The limitation is in CGXMmode
   not the drivers. If the ADVANCED tooltype in CGXMode is not set,
   max is like in the manual. If ADVANCED is set, max is limited to 135 mhz
   in all modes. This does not mean you can you can use 135mhz on all CV64/3Ds.
   Some have reported that you can run at 100mhz in 16bit without problems. 
   If you set this to high you will see some visible display flickering, 
   when moving windows.. etc, no real problems though.


Q: Does the CVision3D have a jumper for older rev9 busters like the CV64?
A: CV3D manual says: "We recommend installing a Buster revision 11 
   for error free functioning of CYBERVISION64/3D". There have been
   a number of people that have reported that the CV3D works just fine
   with older busters (rev9). Pascal Eeftinck {arcade@xs4all.nl} has 
   reported that his 3000UX with a rev6 buster works fine with his CV3D.
   Others have said that older Revs are flakey and when upgraded
   to rev11 works fine.

Q: Does the scandoubler/switcher module from phase 5 require the CVision3D 
   driver to be loaded, or is it a pure hardware solution that will work 
   on the early startup screen, which is presented before ANY 
   software has been loaded?
A: It does not need the driver ... its default standard is 
   passthrough mode with scandoubling.


Q: Does the scandoubler/switcher module from phase 5 work in a A2000 ? 
   Can I use any other Flicker Fixer with CV64/3D
A: No the scandoubler/switcher module does not work in the 2000. 
   Not possible .. the logic is on the scandoubler.. 

Q: Why does the CV64/3D not have a roxxler chip like the CV64, does the 
   ViRGE do some of "its" work and is the CV64 faster at p2c?
A: Cost reduction .. if you compare a cv64 to a cv64/3d much less circuit
   logic is needed.  Yes the ViRGE can do planar 2 chunky conversion too.
   The roxxler can do p2c slightly faster.

Q: Does the scan doubler/switcher module have a video in plug on the 
   backplate, or does it go in the Amiga video slot? 
A: It goes directly in the video slot.

Q: I went to the S3 spec page, and noticed the Virge chip mentioned a video
   digitizer expansion module for the Scenic Highway bus, "Philips
   SAA7110/SAA7111 video digitizers".  Does this imply such a module might be
   sold (or is that up to Phase5?)
A: The CV64/3D has the standard local peripheral bus for scenic mx highway 
   so its not really a hardware problem.  There are many add-on modules
   that would work with the CV64/3D. The big problem is getting 
   drivers/software to fully support the modules. Nothing has been planned
   so far, things are pretty open still.

Q: Can you have both the MPEG and Monitor switcher boards installed at the same
   time on the CyberVision64/3D?
A: Sure, there are seperate connectors for both cards(modules)

Q: Would it take 2 or 1 slots?
A: It take 1 slot if it is in the lowest slot if there is a free video slot.
   This is why the card has such a strange shape, to allow this.

Q: Does the CV64/3D also have hardware ARGB <-> RGBA 24bit data ordering
   conversion, so programs like ShapeShifter in 24bit a modes
   will be as fast as the CV64?
A: Yes CV64/3D has hardware ARGB <-> RGBA 24bit data ordering conversion
   like CV64 has

Q: Does the MPEG module have composite video out (eg NTSC/PAL) & is
   the audio out mono or stereo?
A: Its audio out is stereo, no composite video out though...
   that requires an extra module not even planned yet, but there are
   external vga -> composite video out converters available on the market.

Q: Will there be a video module to get CyberVision64/3D modes to video tape?
A: No module is planed to get video out for the CV64/3D.
   Again, there are external vga -> composite video out
   converters available on the market.

Q: Does the CV64/3D offer higher res graphics modes than the CV64 with same memory?
A: No, it is quite the same display engine. CV64/3D does allow a faster
   memory clock which improves performance in some cases though

   CyberVision64/3D Modes:
   1024x768x24bit  Interlace  800x600x24bit   Non-Interlace
   1280x1024x16bit Interlace  1280x1024x16bit Non-Interlace
   1600x1200x8bit  Interlace  1280x1024x8bit  Non-Interlace

   This are only examples though, in certain cases more is possible.
