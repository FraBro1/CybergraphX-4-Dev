There now are section for V2 & the new V3/V4. Please use the correct section. 
The ENV page for <A href="envvar.html">CyberGraphX V3/V4 is here</A>.
<HR>

<H2><B>CyberGraphX V2</B></H2> has 3 main parts. The libaries in libs:, The Monitor file in devs:monitors 
and The "config" files, the ENV VARs. The installer should install all the files and set all the enviroment settings.
Before you install CyberGraphX you should know the MAX khz of you monitor! 
<HR>
<H2>Libs</H2>
There are 3 main CyberGraphX libraries that are stored in libs: cybergraphics.library, cyberintuition.library and
cyberlayers.library. There is also vilintuisup.library. This is for Picasso II(+) owners to help try
to run older Picasso II(+) software that needs this library. vilintuisup.library MAY let other
CyberGraphX cards run the older Picasso II(+) software BUT it is not really ment for this. One of the side effects 
is that the colors will/might be off or stange/shifted on other cards. The last lib is called gtlayout.library. This is used
by CVMode.
<HR>
<H2>Monitor</H2>
The monitor file that is stored in devs:monitors can be the following: 
Spectrum, Piccolo, Domino, RetinaZ3, PiccoSD64, A2410, CyberVision, DraCoAltais, Picasso
<HR>
<H2>ENV VARs</H2>
CyberGraphX stores all of its config files in env:cybergraphics (and are backed-up in envarc:cybergraphics)
All the libraries are stored in libs: & and the monitor file(s) are stored in devs:Monitors. The following is the "layout" of CyberGraphX.
<BR>
<CENTER>
The following is the layout of env(arc):<BR>
<IMG SRC="envvar.gif" ALT="Env layout" BORDER="0"> 
<BR>RED = Directories, YELLOW = Text Files, BLUE = Monitor Config Files<P>
</CENTER>
What IS needed is the EnvVar is your Monitor and its setting file. In these examples we will use Picasso but you just neet
to replace Picasso with your board name. In the above picture the <Board>Monitor, <Board> can be: 
Spectrum, Piccolo, Domino, RetinaZ3, PiccoSD64, A2410, CyberVision, DraCoAltais, Picasso<P>

PicassoMonitor is a TEXT file that contains the name of the MonitorConfigFile you wish to use.
If you look at the picture above it is Pointing directly to the file that will be used in the <Boards> , in this
case Picasso. CyberGraphX comes with a few default config files: 15khz, 31khz, 35khz, 38khz, 48khz, 57khz, 64khz, 80khz. 
So if your monitors max khz is 57khz and you selected this option in the installer the file
'Monitor-57khz' should be in the ENV:cybergraphics/Picasso dir & the ENV:cybergraphics/PicassoMonitor (a text file)
should have 'Monitor-57khz' in it.<P>

If you have a Domino the layout is a bit different from above. DominoMonitor does not 
point to another config file. It has 1 of 3 options for the khz you wish to run the card in.
They are 38, 50 and 57. So if you want to set it to 50khz, you would type: 
'set cybergraphics/DominoMonitor 50' at the cli prompt. NEXT 'copy env:cybergraphics/DominoMonitor
 to envarc:cybergraphics.<P>

<A NAME="memclock"></A>
For the CyberVision64 and RetinaZ3 there is a ENV called MEMCLOCK. This file goes inside
the <BOARDS> dir (ie. ENV:cybergraphics/CyberVision/MEMCLOCK). MEMCLOCK is the default memory 
clock speed in MHz for the graphics memory on the card. This is just a number.<BR>
<pre>
Card          Default  Low    High   
-------------------------------------
CyberVision64 50mhz    50mhz  80mhz
RetinaZ3      63mhz    20mhz  90mhz
</pre><BR>
You may use higher values, although it may lead to problems when you overclock the memory. In
some cases you have to use lower values if the ram is to slow on the board to support faster speeds.
If you have this set to hight you will see pixel droping or see "grabage" on the screen.

<p>
ENV VARs and what they do.<BR>
The EnvVars in env(arc):cybergraphics are not needed for CyberGraphX, BUT
you can set them to what you want to make CyberGraphX act the way you want.
There are a few tools to making setting these EnvVars easy like CyberPrefsX, a script
to read/change/set them. The EnvVars are just text files with a '0' or '1' in them.
If the EnvVar has a '0' or the files is not found then that feature is not tuned on or disabled.
If the EnvVar has a '1' in it that feature is turned on.

<LI>Note: 'By setting this variable" = setting the file to have a 1 in it. On = 1, Off= 0  
<LI>CPUP2C: By setting this variable, the planar-to-chunky conversion 
    will be done by the CPU (in contrast to the blitter conversion) 
    Therefore the ugly looking planar blitting effects are gone, 
    but the software conversion is slower. 
<LI>HIRESCRSR: By setting this variable, the Lores-Sprites on non-AA-machines 
    become Hires-sprites (they are no longer doubled by 
    the CyberGraphX-Software). 
    This variable is identical to the tooltype HIRESSPRITE of older Picasso-monitor files.
<LI>HIDE15BIT: By setting this variable, you can switch off 15bit modes to reduce 
    screenmode list length. The Modes are still available but hidden.
<LI>ALERTEMU:  By setting this variable, DisplayAlert(), (The Screens you get when the machine crashes.) 
    will be placed on an CyberGraphX screens.
<LI>NOCHIPSCREEN: By setting this variable, 8 bit deep screens are always opened 
    in Fast memory. Useful with 1MB chip systems but you should 
    avoid it with 2MB chip, because the older method is more 
    compatible (no taglist changes etc.) 
<LI>PLANES2FAST: With this option on, non displayable planar bitmaps 
    are allocated in fast memory. This options speeds up 
    handling of planar bitmaps but could lead to problem s
    with amiga graphics which insist on planar graphics 
    placed in chip memory. Take care when using this option.
<LI>NOPASSTHROUGH: If this option is enabled, the monitor switch on every 
    CyberGraphX supported board is deactivated. This option is 
    required for multi monitor systems.
<LI>KEEPAMIGAVIDEO: If this option is disabled, everytime a CyberGraphX display 
    becomes frontscreen, Amiga display DMA is switched off in order 
    to increase chipmem access speed. You can avoid this by enabling 
    this option. 
<LI>BOOTLOGO: If this option is disabled (set to 'No - Off'), the CyberGraphX Bootlogo 
    will not be shown at boot time.
<LI>SAVEMEM: If this option is on, CyberGraphX will reduce memory consumption in less or equal 16 colour 
    modes, CyberGraphX keeps a planar representation of the screen 
    bitmap in fastmem and a chunky representation in video memory.
<LI>BLACKBORDER: It will turn the border black if enabled. IE set to 1. NOTE:
    this is for the Retina BLT Z3 only!
