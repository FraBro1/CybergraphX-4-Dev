Q: AHI seems to have problems with CGX while booting.
A: Try ACTIVATE=1 in the AHI icon tooltype. Also you might try
   upping the stack in the startup-sequence.. at the top..
   'stack 20000' or around there.

Q: I run PatchControl and MCP (and other hacks/patches) in my startup-sequence 
   and CGX V3/V4 seems to crash now.. can I fix this? (Or any other hack/patch)
A: You might try to move the hacks/patches (PatchControl, MCP, ect..) to 
   be run _after_ IPrefs in your startup-sequence and see how it works.
   Another thing would be to try to run the hack into nil, ie:
   "RUN > NIL: MCP" 

Q: CGX V3 seems to be crashing alot with my 060/PPC card.
A: See Q&A above. If that does not help you might try to use:
   setpatch 40.16 (02/14/94).  With later setpatches it's not sure what 
   has really been done and many have reported some kind of problem or another.

Q: When my Amiga boots up I only see the CGX bootlogo for a fraction of
   a second. Is there any way I can leave it up longer?
A: You can make the boologo stay on the screen longer by setting the ToolType
   BOOTLOGO=1 and set the tooltype PASSTROUGH=YES in your monitor file. 
   Then set the ENV VAR NOPASSTHROUGH to 1. If you wish to use NTSC or other
   non-cgx screen modes you can set the ENV VAR NOPASSTHROUGH back to 0 at the end
   of the 's:user-startup' with the line 'setenv CyberGraphX/NOPASSTHROUGH 0'.
A: #2 The bootlogo is only displayed for the time between monitor startup and 
   WB screen open. If you only see the bootlogo for a short time then you 
   just need to delay the opening of the WB screen. As soon as there is 
   con output at boot time it is opened. You could add the WAIT command
   to your startup-sequence before the 'loadwb' line... ie 'WAIT 2' will
   wait 2 seconds. (This will only work with CGX V3/V4, it will not work with V2) 

Q: I run a 1280x1024 screen and there is a "line on the right side of the
   screen". How can I fix this? 
A: You should try to lower the Pixclock to 100mhz or lower. Also anything 
   beyond 100MHz Pixclock will make the pointer flicker because it uses 
   a software crsr.

Q: I just installed CyberGraphX and I am having alot of problems.
A: First thing to do is REMOVE ALL HACKS from your startup-sequence
   and User-Statup and WBStartup. Then go from there.

Q: Why doesn't work Scala with CyberGraphX anymore ? 
A: Make sure, you have the PLANES2FAST option disabled. While this works fine
   for most system use, programs like Scala get into trouble because they are 
   not aware of graphics cards installed in the system. 

Q: I can't get CyberGraphX to work with my new Apollo 4060 accelerator. Why ? 
A: The software setup of the 68060 on the Apollo card is not correct. Please 
   contact the manufacturer of this card to fix this problems.

Q: Why does the the Emplant driver seem not work with CGX V3/V4?
A: When Asked on comp.sys.amiga.emulations: Why does the Emplant not work with 
   the CV3D the following was given:

     No driver will solve this problem.  The CV643D was released after
     Utilities Unlimited went out of business, so there was no driver written
     for it.
A: The emplant drivers 'peeks' inside the cgxbase library pointer.
   An simple update to the Emplant driver should make it work.
A: David Gorton - dgorton@dreamscape.com sent me this:
   "I have talked with Jim Drew about his CGXdrivers for Emplant MacPro. I realize
    that they do not work with V3 and CV64/3D does not support V2. Jim said he
    might never get to a patch or new driver for that product. Since his driver
    peeks inside the Cgxbase.library could this library be patched to allow that
    driver to work with V3? Or is there someone who might be able to fix them
    drivers. Jim would probably give up the sourse code, if asked!"

Q: Why when you use a 24bit Workbench, and you use the menu option
   Window->View By->Name the file names or other parts of the text don't show up?
A: Workbench uses certain operations and calls to draw the text which are 
   not possible on a hi & true color (15/16/24bit) screen. This is not a bug with cgx.

Q: Flickering pointer? I run a 1152x900 screen and them mouse pointer seems
   to flicker alot. 
A: Flickering pointers have nothing to do with the resolution but the 
   pixelclock they selected in CGXMode ... Anything beyond 100MHz Pixclock 
   uses a software crsr.
