<B>CyberGraphX</B> was designed to define an independant graphics
standard for Amiga graphic boards. We also wanted to continue our development
of Workbench emulations. We included all our knowledge of more than 3 years
of graphics board software development for that Amiga which includes Workbench emulation for 
the Visiona, Domino, PicassoII and now the CyberVision64 and CyberVision64/3D.<p>

CyberGraphX is based on hardware dependant monitor drivers and hardware
independant libraries. This has many advantages, one of these being bug fixes 
in the workbench emulation or speed optimizations is a benefit for ALL graphic boards that are
supported by the CyberGraphX system. There is no third party inbetween the
developers and users. This guarantees bug fixes, and continued development of the software in the future.<p>

CyberGraphX works with most major application on the Amiga and there is a large number
of Public Domain and Demo software already made. Also CyberGraphX comes with driver for 
a number of graphics programs.<p>

To use CyberGraphX you need an Amiga with a 68020 with at least AmigaOS 3.0 and a CGX supported Graphics Board.

<b>Some of the CyberGraphX Features:</b>
<ul>
<LI> Universal, hardware independend Cybergraphics-Library with powerful graphics functions for all supported graphics boards.<br>
<LI> Driver for many popular graphics boards provided.<br>
<LI> Modular design, it is possible to use multiple (and different) graphic boards at one time.<br>
<LI> 15/16 and 24 bit support for all intuition screens including Workbench.<br>
<LI> Stable Workbench emulation.<br>
<LI> Real AMIGA look and feel (draggable screens).<br>
<LI> No chipmem required for screen display (fastmem is used).<br>
<LI> System conformity by use of monitor files (DEVS:Monitors).<br> 
<LI> CyberGraphX screen resolutions are selectable from the standard screen mode requester.<br>
<LI> Optimized program code for incredible fast graphics operations.<br>
<LI> Extensive support of the improved and added features by application software from leading software providers.<br>
<LI> <B>NEW CyberGraphX V3 Features over CGX V2</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Multiple views - Multiple views means multi monitor system .. you can display different CGX screens on several monitors simultaneously. 
  <LI>Multi monitor system support - Plug in several cards and you can open screens on every card, they are updated even if not currently active, that was not possible before if you plugged in several cards connect to different monitors with v2, only the active CGX screen was updated
  <LI>Horizontal screen dragging
  <LI>Works completely without chip ram
  <LI>Real memory management - Hidden screen management, off screen bitmaps in card, management of 3d texture data, video overlays, ect.. 
  <LI>Support for multiple boards of the same kind
  <LI>V3 is freely available for the end user, ie free
  <LI>Isis & the cgxmpeg.library - Osiris works 100%
  <LI>Improved CGXMode                                           
</UL>
<LI> <B>A few of the NEW CyberGraphX V4 Planed Features over CGX V2</B>
<UL>
  <LI>German/English documentation/online help for CGXMode 
  <LI>CGXMode monitor database 
  <LI>CGXCommodity (cgx config program) for control of envs and tooltypes and some superlayers features like hide/show windows
  <LI>Fully compatible with CGX V3
  <LI>Bitmapcache support added for all drivers (supported cards)
  <LI>Latest V43 24Bit DT, picture.datatype will come with it.
</UL>

<B><H2>CyberGraphX Credits:</H2></B>
 * The following people and firms we would like to thank. Without some of
them CyberGraphX would not exist in its current state:<P>
<ul>
<LI><B>Stefan Ossowski's Schatztruhe Gesellschaft für Software mbH</B> - for V4 distribution!
<LI><B>phase5 digital products</B> - for the development of a new graphics board over 2 years ago which was decisive for the development of CyberGraphX at the very beginning.
<LI><B>Thomas Sontowski</B> - Who actually was the first that brought retargetable intuition graphics to the Amiga!
<LI><B>Ralph Schmidt</B> - For his valuable help with tips and suggestions with intuition and graphics.
<LI><B>Olaf Barthel</B> - For suggestions and tests of the first versions as well as development of a driver for the photo CD application PhotoWorx, vilintuisup.library and further very valuable tips and notes
<LI><B>Matthias Scheler</B> - For developing CyberView and CyberWindow and his testing
<LI><B>Stefan Becker</B> - For testing and developing CVMode although he must have known that he does not make new friends with it :)
<LI><B>Andreas Goiczyk</B> - For being one of the first beta testers of CyberGraphX on his Piccolo Z3 graphics board
<LI><B>All users</B> - Who sent all kinds of input to help improving the CyberGraphX system
<LI><B>Bernd Münchgesang</B> - For hardware support at the very beginning of development
<LI><B>Uwe Roehm</B> - Für creating the CyberGraphX ImageFX Render module
<LI><B>Henning Friedl</B> - From MacroSystem for his help concerning RetinaZ3
<LI><B>MacroSystem</B> - For their hardware/technical support
<LI><B>Ingenieurbuero Helfrich</B> - For all kind of information and hardware related to their Piccolo cards
<LI><B>Klaus Burkert</B> - VillageTronic for providing some PicassoII+ related information.
<LI><B>Ignatios Souvatzis</B> - For the energetic support with the development of the A2410 of driver 
<LI><B>Andreas Frank</B> - Rainbow CGX text logo.
<LI><B>All people who registered</B> - the shareware version, bought the commercial version of CyberGraphX V2 or even got a CyberVision64. They are the reason why CyberGraphX became the standard that it is today.
