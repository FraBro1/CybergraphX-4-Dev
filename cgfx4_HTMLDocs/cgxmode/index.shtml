OVERVIEW- You should read this complete page so that you have a good understanding on how
CGXMode works, what number it wants and how it reacts with your monitor. It does not
get to heavy into tecnobabble as most all the other monitor pages do and it is geared around
CGXMode and the terms it uses vs what your monitor manual migiht use. 
The AA(AGA) and A2410 drivers will not use CGXMode. If you have any questions 
let us know at <A href="mailto:cgxmode@vgr.com">cgxmode@vgr.com</A>.<BR>

   This is the current graphic card(s) that you will be using CGXMode with.
   <UL>
   <LI>If you are not using CGXMode 2.6 then you need to upgrade. You can get it from the latest CGX archive or
       you can get it here: <A HREF="CGXMode26.lha">2.6</A> - <A HREF="CGXMode27.lha">2.7</A>
   <LI>CGXMode 2.6 (or 2.5beta1) and later version will now scan the list of CyberGraphX cards that are 
       are installed and add them into the listview... thus giving you multi-board support
       directly in CGXMode
   <LI>CGXMode before 2.6 (or 2.5beta1) you must set a tooltype to the board you wish to edit 
       modes on and can only edit i at a time. <FONT COLOR=#FF0000>NOTE:</FONT COLOR> You can ONLY use the following with the older CGXModes: 
     CVision64, Piccolo, PicassoII, PicassoIV, Spectrum, RetinaZ3, PiccoSD64, CVision3D.
      EXAMPLE: if you have a Picasso II graphics card you need to set the tooltype like this:
     BOARD=PicassoII   You need to set this to the card you use with one of the options above.
   </UL>

 <LI><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Monitor Specification:</FONT COLOR></B>
    This is the config file that CGXMode will use and save change to. 
   <UL> 
   <LI>CGXMode will read the BOARD tooltype (with pre 2.6 CGXModes), in this example PicassoII, will look for
       ENV:CyberGraphX/PicassoIIMonitor. It will then read the config file that is set in 
       ENV:CyberGraphX/PicassoIIMonitor. ENV:CyberGraphX/{board}Monitor, where {board} is what
       is set in the tooltype BOARD.
   <LI><B>First Time Usage</B> If you are using CGXMode for the first time you NEED
       to find the MAX KHZ value your monitor will support. Once you do this you can
       use the built in DEFAULT values by using the pulldown menus (Settings) and selecting
       the value your monitor supports. Once you do this you will see a bunch of default
       screenmodes that you can customize for your personal taste and monitor.     
   <LI><B>First Time Usage</B> - EDIT BUTTON: Pressing this will allow you to enter your monitor values. This
       will let you set the all the MIN and MAX values for your make and model. You need to do this first before
       you start editing screenmodes. 
       <A HREF="#monitorspecs">See the Monitor Specification section below</A>.

   <LI><B>New:</B> This will make a new entry at the bottom of the screenmode listview. You then
        can select it, and then edit it. <B>NOTE:</B> If you are going to make a brand new mode then
        you can use the NEW button and then use EDIT to config the mode for your monitor.
   <LI><B>Edit:</B> You can select a screenmode in the listview then hit edit to goto the edit
        window for that mode. <A HREF="#screencfg">See the Edit Mode section below</A>
   <LI><B>/\:</B> When you have a screen mode selected in the listview you can use the {up arrow}
        key to move up the list to the next screenmode. You also can use the "/" key.
   <LI><B>\/:</B> When you have a screen mode selected in the listview you can use the {down arrow}
        key to move down the list to the next screenmode. You also can use the "\" key.
   <LI><B>Clone:</B> This will take the current selected screen mode and make a copy of it and place the new 
       mode at the bottom of the listview. <B>NOTE:</B> If you want to make a new mode that is very close
       to a mode that you are already using use CLONE. Example: You want to make a 640x400 mode... just select
       the 640x480 mode from the screenmode listview and hit CLONE.. then you can edit the new mode to the specs 
       you want.
   <LI><B>Delete:</B> This will take the current selected screenmode and delete it from the modes that are available.
       It will remove it from the listview. If you save & quit it will be gone.

<H2>Monitor Specification</H2><BR>
This is where you can tell CGXMode the display specifications for your monitor. The manual for 
your monitor should have most of these numbers in the back. If it does not then you should
contact the MFG of your monitor (or check their web site) to get the correct numbers. 
The more numbers you can feed into
the Monitor Specification settings the more you can get out of your monitor with CGX. If you 
plug a few numbers in and guess others it _will_ be a pain to edit screen modes and you will
not get the results you need or want. MAKE SURE you input the correct numbers, if you guess and
you are wrong you might damage your monitor: You will see this everytime you edit your
monitors specification:<BR>

 <LI><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Bandwidth [MHz]:</FONT COLOR></B>
     This is the maximum dots per second that your monitor can do. This
     is sometimes called dot clock or driving clock frequency. This
     is measured in Megahertz (MHz). This is the number of signal periods per seconds.
     1 time per second = 1 Hz. 1kHz = 1000Hz (One thousand Hz), 1MHz=1000000Hz (One million Hz).
     If you set the bandwidth to high then the display may become fuzzy or blurry. 

 <LI><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Horizontal Frequency [kHz]:</FONT COLOR></B>

       you must enter correctly and should not guess! Underdriving your monitor could 
       damage it. Older and 'cheaper' monitors do not have any protection against this.
       Some newer and 'better' monitors have protection against underdriving.. but
       you should never count on that. It is best to use the correct number for your monitor!
       This number is measured in Kilohertz (kHz).

       The horizontal Blanking period (Sync Length) is how long it takes the monitor to 
       move the beam from the end of one scan line to the next and start 'drawing' again on the next scan line.
       Some monitors have a minimum limit on how short this time may be.
       The number is in Microseconds (not Dot(s)). If your monitor's manual only has
       numbers for Dot(s) for Vertical Synchronization use this formula to convert it:<BR>

<H2>Edit Mode</H2><BR>
To use the Edit Mode and get the most out of it would be best to understand some of the terms
that are used. The problem is that many times there are 4 or 5 different terms that could mean the same thing.
This makes it hard to take your monitors information and move it into what CGXMode wants.
Below is a generic timing example from the back of a
Nanao Flexscan F560iW manual. These terms seem to be used alot for different monitor mfgs and seems
to be a good middle ground to match upto CGXMode's terms. You should see something like the timing layout below 
for your monitor. If it does not then you should contact the MFG of your monitor 
(or check their web site) to get the correct numbers.<BR>

Here is the same basic timing layout with the numbers that CGXMode wants in bold-bigger text and
what same thing in the Nanao manual refers to them as. This should help you take the numbers and terms from
your monitor's manual and compare them to both of these charts to figure out what numbers from your
monitor's manual and where to plug them into CGXMode.

 <LI><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Name:</FONT COLOR></B>
   This is the name of the mode that you will be editing. It has the color depth in Bits
   and the horizontal and vertical resolution in the screen name.

 <LI><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Hidden:</FONT COLOR></B>
   If this is selected for this screen mode then that mode will be hidden in the 
   display database. You may make a few test modes and not want them to clutter up
   the scren mode list in Prefs/ScreenMode or any other program that uses the
   display database for its screen. This will work for any screen mode.
   
 <LI><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Type:</FONT COLOR></B>
   This is the number of bit planes that will be used for this screen mode. Your options are:
   8Bit (256 Colors), 16Bit (65.536 Colors) and 24Bit (16,777,216 Colors). You can not edit 
   15bit screen modes. What CGX does is copy the 16Bit modes and makes entries in the display
   database with the same number of 15bit modes with the same specs. What is different is
   a different pixel layout. 15Bit has 5 5 5 (5bits Red, 5Bits Green, 5Bits Blue).
   16Bit has 5 6 5 (5bits Red, 6Bits Green, 5Bits Blue). Both modes use 2bytes/pixel,
   15bit has one bit unused.

 <LI><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Scan Mode:</FONT COLOR></B>
   <UL>
   <LI><B>Normal</B> - Every scanline is displayed, one after another.
   <LI><B>Interlace</B> - Every other scanline is displayed this allowing for a larger resolution screen to be displayed.
       The first pass lines 1-3-5-7-9-etc are displayed, the next pass line 2-4-6-8-10-ect are displayed. This 
       generates flicker when updating between odd and even fields.
   <LI><B>Doublescan</B> - Draws every line 2 times. It will draw line 1 then draw line 1 again.. then move on to line 2
       and draw that 2 times and then line 3 etc..  
       If you want to use doublescan with a mode that has a horizontal refresh frequency of 35khz in normal scan mode, 
       your monitors needs to support 70khz.
       It is only used for small vertical resolutions like 320x200 or 640x200
       
   </UL>
 <LI><B><FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Pixel Clock:</FONT COLOR></B>
   This is the total number of pixels that can be displayed in one second.
   Value is in MHz ie. 85 [Mhz] -> 85 million pixels / second.
   Also sometimes called dotclock. If this number to high you will get a bad or no display.
   The value you enter here is limited by the bandwidth of the graphics card 
   and the mode type that is selected. For most cards maximum graphics card bandwidth varies depending on the depth.
   Anything beyond 100MHz Pixel Clock will make the pointer flicker because it uses a software cursor insted of 
   having the gfx card use its hardware cursor.

 <LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>Sync Length:</B></FONT COLOR>
   Horizontal Sync Length (Blanking Period) = 
   Pulse Offset(Front Porch) + Pulse Length(Sync Pulse) + (Back Porch). The
   Sync Length (Blanking Period) is the total time that the monitor needs 
   to move the beam from the end of one line and to the start of the next.
   This includes the Front/Back Porches that surround the actual Sync Pulse
   that tells the monitor to move the beam to the next frame. Sync Length is use to change
   the size of the viewing area.
   When the Sync Length is made smaller the Horizontal size of the display is increased.
   This is becase you are making the borders smaller making more room for more viewable screen area. 
   Reducing the sync length, increases horizontal refresh rate and that is limited by the monitor. 
   Just the opposite happens when you make the Sync Length larger. You make the borders bigger 
   thus leaving less room for viewable display area. 
   That is why monitors with low horizontal refresh rates often are not that flexible when it comes to border sizes.

   When you change the pulse offset you are moving the starting horizontal position of the border,
   thus moving the viewable area with it.
   Increasing the Pulse Offset 탎 will move the screen to the left. Decreasing the 탎
   will move the screen to the right.     
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>Pulse Length:</B></FONT COLOR>
   Pulse Length(Sync Pulse) is the actual pulse that tells the monitor to move the beam to the next scan line.
   Pulse length specifies the duration of the pulse in 탎. You can't modify anything really by increasing
   or decreasing the Pulse Length it just needs to be over the minimum that the monitor can handle.
   If you change the value alot the monitor probably needs to resync and the scren may move in unpredictable

<UL>
 <LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>Sync Length:</B></FONT COLOR>
   Horizontal Sync Length (Blanking Period) = 
   Pulse Offset(Front Porch) + Pulse Length(Sync Pulse) + (Back Porch). The
   Sync Length (Blanking Period) is the total time that the monitor needs 
   to move the beam from the end of one line and to the start of the next.
   This includes the Front/Back Porches that surround the actual Sync Pulse
   that tells the monitor to move the beam to the next frame. Sync Length is use to change
   the size of the viewing area.
   When the Sync Length is made smaller the Horizontal size of the display is increased.
   This is becase you are making the borders smaller making more room for more viewable screen area. 
   Reducing the sync length, increases horizontal refresh rate and that is limited by the monitor. 
   Just the opposite happens when you make the Sync Length larger. You make the borders bigger 
   thus leaving less room for viewable display area. 
   That is why monitors with low horizontal refresh rates often are not that flexible when it comes to border sizes.
   The number is in 탎 (microseconds)
 <LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>Pulse Offset:</B></FONT COLOR>
   Pulse Offset(Front Porch) is the window in time just before the the monitor gets the Sync Pulse to tell it to move the beam
   to the next scan line. This can be used to to center the screen.
   When you change the pulse offset you are moving the starting horizontal position of the border,
   thus moving the viewable area with it.
   Increasing the Pulse Offset 탎 will move the screen to the left. Decreasing the 탎
   will move the screen to the right.     
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>Pulse Length:</B></FONT COLOR>
   Pulse Length(Sync Pulse) is the actual pulse that tells the monitor to move the beam to the next scan line.
   Pulse length specifies the duration of the pulse in 탎. You can't modify anything really by increasing
   or decreasing the Pulse Length it just needs to be over the minimum that the monitor can handle.
   If you change the value alot the monitor probably needs to resync and the scren may move in unpredictable
   ways. Its not real good for "editing" a mode.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>Polarity:</B></FONT COLOR>
   Specifies the polarity of the actual sync pulse.
  <UL>
   <LI><B>Negative</B> - Sync Pulse is negative
   <LI><B>Positive</B> - Sync Pulse is positive
  </UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>Frequency [kHz]</B></FONT COLOR>
   This is the final horizontal frequency in Kilohertz that will be used for that screen mode.

<H2>CGXMode Tooltypes</H2><BR>

Below is a list of current tooltypes for CGXMode:<BR> 




<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 WIDTH=100%> 

<TR BGCOLOR=#777777>
<TD><B>Tooltype OFF</B></TD>
<TD><B>Tooltype ON</B></TD>  
</TR>


<TR BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>
<TD><B>(ADVANCED)</A></B>: 
If the ADVANCED tooltype is 'off' (ie not there or setup like '(ADVANCED)') then CGXMode will not be in the in ADVANCED mode.
This means that CGXMode will do the math so that when you
edit a screen it will not allow you to overdrive or push your monitor specs out side of the monitors range. 
This is more or less a safety check. 
<FONT COLOR=#FF0000>You should check to see if ADVANCED tooltype is there before you start editing
screenmodes if you wish CGXMode to check for overdriving your monitor!</FONT COLOR>
</TD> 

<TD><B>ADVANCED</A></B>:
If the ADVANCED tooltype is there then CGXMode will NOT do 'the math', thus it will not do 
safety check on the numbers you input and if you overdriver your monitor (enter a number that is to high or to low)
you could damage your monitor. Overdriving or underdriving your monitor could 
       damage it. Older and 'cheaper' monitors do not have any protection against this.
       Some newer and 'better' monitors have protection against overdriving or underdriving.. but
       you should never count on that. If you do not understand what all the numbers you are
editing for a screen in CGXMode do and how they related to the MAX and MIN for your monitor you should NOT USE the ADVANCED Mode.

<H2>CGXMode Error Messages</H2><BR>

Below is a list of errors you might get from CGXMode:<BR> 




<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=1 WIDTH=100%> 

<TR BGCOLOR=#777777>
<TD><B>Error Message</B></TD>
<TD><B>What it means</B></TD>  
</TR>


<TR BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>
<TD><B>Can't update testmode definition</A></B>: 
</TD> 
<TD>
You might have the wrong cgx library and monitor driver combination.
Your libs/monitordirver/cgxmode are not current and you should try to update to the latest of everything.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR BGCOLOR=#FFFFFF>
<TD><B>Can't open test screen</A></B>: 
</TD> 
<TD>
Can't open test screen happened with old cgxmode's when you wanted to modify a card displaymode although the driver was not installed.
Also if you are low on fast memory with the old CGXMode you also might get this error.
The new cgxmode versions use a new interface to update the test mode config.
From r69a readme: "added 2 new LVOs to cgxsystem.library that handle communication with CGXMode"
You should try to update to the latest CGX and latest CGXMode.
