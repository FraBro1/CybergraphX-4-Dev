Dear XiPaint User!

Thank you for using this product. XiPaint 4.0 gives you many
new features - and we still develop this product. For the reason
to have to the right tool also the right surroundings, I thought,
the best way is to make a CD which have all things you need to
paint.

It is not the program alone, that satisfies - it's also the handling,
the support the tools and the demonstration. Therefore, this CD
gives you many import and export-modules, pictures, materials and
and and.

For a nice price it was necessary to have the manual on CD.

Manual
======

For this reason, I made AmigaGuide-Manuals, ASCII, and printable
files to put out to your printer (in Deskjet, Laserjet and
Postscript-Format). Only copy the desired files to your printer
or click on the icon.

The manual is made for version 3.0 - but its still the actual
one. The new features are explained seperately.

If you want to have a printed manual, you can get it at MacroSystem
or NoahJi's.

If you have troubles with the Laserjet-manual (the pages are printed
only a half), so please stop printing and print before the manual
a graphical page with an other programm (PC, or Amiga). I couldn't
reproduce this - so I hope, this will help ...

The nice multipic.library is copyright by MacroSystem (Thanks) and
I need it for loading and saving. Its not freeware - but every
XiPaint user may use it. From Mr. Hoffmann I got a demo of his
fast external loaders. If you want to work with the full-version,
please register you! More details are in the Shareware-folder.

An other nice thing is Graffity. It's a Workbench emulation for
the Omnibus, Merlin, Domino, Graffity and Picasso. So XiPaint is
also available for this graphic-adapters.

If you want to use the WACOM-tablett, you need the driver from
Roland Schwingel, which is also in the Shareware-directory.

Problems
========

If you have problems with starting XiPaint, so please use the little
programm xpinit on the CD. Start it from the xipaint-drawer, where
the main-programm is found. It tells you something about your
libraries and versions and where there are.

If you have no idea, why XiPaint can't find libraries, please copy
all xipaint/libs/#? - libraries to libs:

If you have a VLAB and no VLAB-Menu will open, so please start xipaint
from a shell with the option 7. This bug will be fixed in the next version.

Have you problems with loading your pictures? Maybe your loading-module
is Internal-DEEP. Change this in the System-Folder under loader to the
multipic-module (also for Saver).

The following bug is fixed in this version of XiPaint:
* Picture to Brush has the same sizes

The following bug is known:
* Raytracer-progressbar is to slow

Thanks
