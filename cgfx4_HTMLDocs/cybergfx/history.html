 cybergraphics Revision 40.113
 ------------------------------
  - MovePixelArray()/cybergraphics does not trash register D2 anymore.
    This fixes a register trashing problem with BltBitmap()/graphics on
    truecolour bitmaps, too.
  - fixed conversion bug with RGBA/ARGB scaling in ScalePixelArray()/cgx
    when destination bitmap format was RGB15

 cybergraphics Revision 40.111
 ------------------------------
   - graphics/BitMapScale() now also supports scaling of chunky,hicolour and
     truecolour bitmaps. It only worked for planar destinations before.

 cybergraphics Revision 40.108
 ------------------------------
   - gained some speed when allocating true colour bitmaps with
     graphics/AllocBitMap() that don't need to be cleared. This may improve
     window refresh performance sligtly for large windows.

 cybergraphics Revision 40.107
 ------------------------------
   - flood fills are a bit faster for planar bitmaps now. This should improve
     performance for certain flood fill operations on workbench icons.

 cybergraphics Revision 40.106
 ------------------------------
   - improved speed auf RECTFMT_LUT8 WritePixelArray()/cybergraphics call
     on 15/16 bit rgb colour screens. Apps like Frodo4.0 which use
     WritePixelArray/RECTFMT_LUT8 may gain a litte speed due to the
     optimized call. Stack usage increases though.

 Revision 40.105
 ------------------------------
   - improved speed auf RECTFMT_LUT8 WritePixelArray()/cybergraphics call
     on 8 bit screens. It should be as fast as WritePixelArray8()/graphics
     patch now. Apps or games which have cybergraphx support and use
     WritePixelArray/RECTFMT_LUT8 instead of WritePixelArray8 may gain a
     litte speed due to the optimized call.

 Revision 40.104
 ------------------------------
   - added some code to get powersnap working on truecolour screens

 Revision 40.103
 ------------------------------
   - Due to a bug in the rect filling code, swapping/toggling of simple refresh
     windows got really slow unter truecolour screens with previous v2 versions.
     There is really a VISIBLE speed INCREASE with that fixed now when using
     simple refresh windows.

   - added flood()/graphics replacement. Programs like PPaint should now work
     completely without chipram when cybergraphics/PLANES2FAST=1 


 Revision V40.95
 --------------
   - fixes serious bug in FillPixelArray (register A6 was trashed under
     certain conditions)

 Revision V40.89
 ---------------
   - added src bitmap = 0 check in BltBitmap() replacement
   - changed revision numbering scheme
   - fixed bug in CVideoCtrlTagList()/cgfx
   - all screen structure dependencies in ViewFuncs module removed. Now only
     uses view/viewport structures
   - the GetDTAttrs patch now checks if the source bitmap is already a
     cybergraphx map and terminates early if possible
     (This saves some memory when the v43 pcdt is installed)
   - fixed softcrsr background refresh  bug when dragging
     nextscreens
   - fixed a bug with XORed BltPattern() calls which contained
     a mask (went wrong in all colormodes)
   - software cursor works on nextscreens, too, now
   - optimized software cursor support
   - Changed AllocBitMap to avoid Wordworth 4/5 problems with
     SPECIALFMT bitmaps
   - minor speed improvements in CopyCyberMap RGB24->RGB16
     copying
   - fixed a minor bug in SetRGB32()/gfx patch
   - changed BitMapInfo structure

 Revision V40.65
 -----------------------------
   - fixed bug in ReadRGBPixel, it always returned 0 before
   - changed some code in BltBitmap & BltMaskBitmapRastPort to
     fix some problems with bob mask handling
   - ri_RxOffset parameter is now supported, too with ScrollVPort()
     CyberGraphX viewport scrolling
   - GetBitmapAttr() graphics now correctly returns BMF_INTERLEAVED
     for interleaved bitmaps in fast memory
   - fixed a compatibility problem in AllocBitmap()/gfx patch in
     conjunction with allocation of 24 bit friend bitmaps
   - fixed bug in WritePixelArray()/cgfx. When SrcFormat was
     RECTFMT_RGB, destination rastport was of ARGB type and width was less
     or equal 3, the function did not work properly
   - fixed some more problems in conjunction with NONLINEAR memory
     display cards & screen toggling
   - the SAVEMEM option should now work with NONLINEAR memory
     display cards, too - even though this option is not
     recommended for this boards due to heavy speed loss
   - added ScrollVPort()/gfx patch to support RasInfo/ScrollVPort
     style doublebuffering
   - added AllocDBufInfo()/gfx patch. Returns 0 in case of cyber
     graphx viewports because CyberGraphX doesn't support
     intuition/graphics v3.0 double buffering
   - added new tag CYBRBIDTG_BoardName to BestCModeIDTags()/cgfx
   - added workaround for workbench.library's view by name bug in 16/32
     bit modes

     SAVEMEM option
   - changes in planar Draw()/gfx
   - (Un)LockBitmap(Tags)()/cgfx calls now hide/set cursor correctly
     if a software cursor is enabled.
   - fixed a bug in RECTFMT_GREY8 scaling in conjunction with
     PIXFMT_RGB15 bitmaps (ScalePixelArray()/cgfx)
   - fixed a bug in magnified scaling code (RECTFMT_RGB as well
     as RECTFMT_GREY8) (ScalePixelArray()/cgfx)
   - In order to reduce memory consumption in less or equal 16 colour
     modes, CyberGraphX now keeps a planar representation of the screen
     bitmap in fastmem and a chunky representation in video memory if
     the NOCHIPSCREEN option is switched on.
   - italic text printing works again (was broken since srcx BltTemplate
     fix)
   - Planar2Chunky()/driver call is used more often even in RGB modes
     now if board supports hardware planar2chunky conversion
   - minor optimizations in Write&ScalePixelArray/cgfx()
   - BltTemplate()/gfx srcX>127 did not work properly. Now fixed
   - diverse changes in CopyCyberMap()/cgfx

   - removed some incompatibility issues in conjunction with the
     PLANES2FAST option that occured since 40.63 (DOpus 5.11 crashes etc.)

   - fixed some more bugs in chunky->planar BltMaskBitMapRastPort
     /gfx code
   - added UnLockBitMapTagList() call to support application
     display refresh for non-linear access video boards (e.g. AmiWin & A2410)

     is off and a CGraphX view is frontmost.
   - CYBRMREQ_CModelArray tag is now supported with AllocModeList()/cybergfx.
     It was ignored before.
   - changed BestCyberModeID MinDiff algorithm (dX^2+ dY^2)
   - fixed bug in BltMaskBitMapRastPort()/gfx. When an 8bit chunky
     source bitmap was supplied and the destination rastport was
     8bit chunky, too, this call went wrong.
   - extended BltMaskBitMapRastPort()/gfx now supports non planar
     source bitmaps
   - fixed writemask bug in BltBitmap()/gfx when CPUP2C was on and -1/0 dummy
     planes were used as source data
   - diverse bug fixes in ScalePixelArray()/cybergraphics.lib
   - again made some changes to the sprite funcs

 Revision V40.62

   - the black period while screens are toggled is slightly
     reduced now.
   - screen dragging is not available with non linear video boards
     anymore now
   - fixed IconEdit Save Icon bug in 8bit now, too (When saving an Icon while

     is fixed now,it was more likely an IconEdit bug but.
   - all icon mask clipping bugs should be fixed now in 8 bit
     modes
   - fixed major bug in BitmapScale()/gfx, Font-Preferences and
     font scaling should work without problems.
  ( - all Forbid()s/Permit()s are replaced by semaphore calls now )
   - WritePixelArray with RECTFMT_GREY8 is optimized for all
     16/32bit pixelmodes now

   - PLANES2FAST and NOPASSTHROUGH environment variables may be changed
     while the system is running now
   - fixed bug in CPUP2C variable change detection
   - fixed IconEdit Save Icon bug (When saving an Icon while the
     window was leftmost, some display corruption occured). Though it
     is fixed now,it was more likely an IconEdit bug but.

 Revision V40.57

   - fixed bug in FillPixelArray
   - added faster text output again

 Revision V40.56
 --------------------------------

     'CyberGraphX'
   - fast memory planes are now allocated with MEMF_ANY instead
     of MEMF_FAST
   - fixed problems with fast memory planes and interleaved bitmaps
   - made some changes in the line drawing code
   - added new environment variable KEEPAMIGAVIDEO. If this
     option is disabled, everytime a CyberGraphX display becomes
     frontscreen, AMIGA DMA is switched off. You can avoid this
     by enabling this option.
   - added new environment variable NOPASSTHROUGH. If this option
     is enabled, the monitor switch on every CyberGraphX
     supported board is deactivated. This option is required for
     multi monitor systems.
   - fixed some problems in the lores crsr sprite code
   - added new environment variable PLANES2FAST. With this option
     on, AllocBitmap() allocates non displayable planar bitmaps
     in fast memory

     brushed failed in 40.50

 Revision 40.50
 ------------------------------------------
   - fixed some problems in the envvar part (if some variables were
     missing, certain vars were set wrong)
   - made some changes in the Alloc/FreeBitMap() stuff
   - icons/bobs are correctly clipped on 8bit screens now
   - added possibility to allocate special pixfmt bitmaps with
     AllocBitmap() by supplying some additional flags
     If bit 7 of the flags parameter is set, bits 31-24 of the flags
     ULONG are used as the pixel format descriptor (UBYTE, see
     cybergraphics.(i|h)) You have to supply the correct depth, too !
     For example AllocBitmap(640,480,16,((PIXFMT_BGR16PC<<24)|128),0L)
     would give you a 16bit deep bitmap in BGR16PC pixel format.
     You can also use it to directly allocate chunky bitmaps without
     the friend bitmap parameter.
   - fixed minterm 0xf0 BltBitmap() support. Things like
     Twist2 multiselect marks in list mode should work now

<H2><B>cyberintuition.library</B></H2>


 Revision V40.34
 --------------
   - the tags SA_Draggable,SA_DClip,SA_BlockPen,SA_DetailPen are
     now supported correctly
   - fixed some problems with 8bit screens when no SA_Depth tag
     was supplied and the NOCHIPSCREEN is enabled

 ------------------------------
   - The OpenScreenTags() patch now sets the SA_ErrorCode field 
     for cybergraphx internal faults,too if the tag is available

 Revision V40.30
 ------------------------------
   - all NOCHIPSCREEN bitmaps are allocated with BMF_DISPLAYABLE
     flag now
   - fixed bug in conjunction with NOCHIPSCREEN option. Even if
     Closescreen() returned FALSE, the custom screen bitmap was
     freed. (fixed PGS3 crashes)
   - SAVEMEM bitmaps are always alloc'ed interleaved now
   - fixed bug in OpenScreenTagList(). EraseRect()'s xMax was not
     inside the screen's bitmap region which caused memory corruption
     when SAVEMEM & NOCHIPSCREEN was switched on
   - added new option SAVEMEM to switch <= 16 colour fast planar
     memory consumption reduction feature on/off

   - screen bitmap is now cleared before a NOCHIPSCREEN screen is
     opened

 Revision V40.25
 ------------------------------
   - DisplayBeep() now only inverts title bar for 0.1 secs
     instead of changing background colour for a short
     time on extended screens which could lead to colour
     refresh problems.

 Revision V40.24
 ---------------------------------
   - fixed CloseScreen() bug that was introduced with the
     NOCHIPSCREEN option

 Revision 40.23
 -----------------------------------
   - added new environment variable cybergraphics/NOCHIPSCREEN.
     If this is switched on, 8 bit deep screens are always opened
     in Fast memory. Useful with 1MB chip systems but you should
     avoid it with 2MB chip, because the older method is more
     compatible (no taglist changes etc.).
   - there should  be no loss of memory anymore when changing
     workbench resolution
   - added SA_SysFont parsing to extended screen open
   - SA_Pens default Tag is not passed on extended cybergfx
     WorkBench screens anymore. This fixes some problems with
     multi-color mode and pen assignments on workbench
   - colour pens ~3 & ~2 are now allocated correctly when wbench
     is opened on an extended screen
   - SA_Type is now passed through correctly on extended screens
