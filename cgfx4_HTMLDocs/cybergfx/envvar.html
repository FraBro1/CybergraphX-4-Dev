<HR>
There now are section for V2 & the new V3/V4. Please use the correct section.
The ENV page for <A href="envvarV2.html">CyberGraphX V2 is here</A>.
<HR>

<H2><B>CyberGraphX V3/V4</B></H2> has had many changes in layout vs V2. The libraries in libs:, The Monitor file in devs:monitors ,
and The "config" files and ENV VARs are all the same. New with V3/V4 is tooltypes for the Monitor file. The installer should have installed all the files and set all the enviroment settings 
and tooltypes, but you can check here to see if something is missing or set up wrong.
Before you install CyberGraphX you should know the MAX khz of your monitor! 
<HR>
<H2>Libs</H2>
The 3 main CyberGraphX V2 libraries have been moved into 1 file, this is called cgxsystem.library
There is a new lib called cgxbootpic.library, this has the boot picture information. 
<P>
vilintuisup.library still can be used with V3/V4 if you wish, but is becomming outdated. This is for Picasso II(+) owners to help try
to run older Picasso II(+) software that needs this library. vilintuisup.library MAY let other
CyberGraphX cards run the older Picasso II(+) software BUT it is not really ment for this. One of the side effects 
is that the colors will/might be off or stange/shifted on other cards. 
<P>
gtlayout.library is still around for V3/V4. This is used by CGXMode.
<P>
If you have a CV3D then you should have cgxvideo.library installed. This is the lib for stuff like
video overlay and other video function that the CV3D can do.
<P>
Last library comes from the Isis archive. This is a MPEG player for CGX. It is called
cgxmpeg.library. This does not come with CGX Updates.. but again is in the Isis archive and 
if you ran the installer should be installed int he libs: dir.<BR>

<H2>Monitor</H2>
The monitor file that is stored in devs:monitors can be the following: 
CVision3D, CVision64, Spectrum, Piccolo, PiccoSD64, PicassoII, Inferno, AGA.  NOTE the name changes for from 
Cybervision to CVision64, and Picasso to PicassoII for V3/V4 release.
<P>
Also the ConfigFiles for V3/V4 have moved. NOTE: In V2 they were stored in ENV(ARC):Cybergraphics/<GFXCARD_NAME>, 
they now are stored at: sys:prefs/presets/monitors.
<P>
NOTE: you MUST NOT change the MonitorDriver name. For example if you have a CyberVision64... the monitordriver
name in devs:monitors is CVision64 and with that the CVision64.info file. If you rename the Monitordriver
to 'CV' or anyother name the driver WILL NOT find the tooltypes. If it can't find the tooltype then CGX V3/V4
will not get setup the way you want.
<HR>
<H2>ToolTypes</H2>
The Tooltype are where you can set a few settings that will effect That 1 board. So if you have say a CV64 and PicassoII
in 1 system, there are settings that can effect just 1 card not all that are installed in the system.
<P>
In this example we will use the CVision3D. You need to go into the DEVS dir on your system partition. Then into 
the Monitors directory. Now click 1 time on the  CVision3D icon. Then with the pulldown-menus select 
Icons->Information.... this will get you information onthat file... This is where you can set the tooltypes.

<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>ADVANCEDCLK</B></FONT COLOR>
    For CV64 and CV64/3D ONLY! Allows 'overclocking' of the CV64/CV3D cards,
    Limiter has been moved from inside cgxmodeV4 to the drivers.
    The old cgxmodes increased maximum pixclocks when ADVANCED tooltype was set, 
    now overclocking the cv cards can only be enabled by the driver itself. 
    CgxmodeV4 now gets max pixclocks from the gfx card drivers.<BR>

</pre><BR>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>PACKED24:</B></FONT COLOR>
    For the CyberVisionPPC ONLY! To enable/disable packed pixel mode
    for 24bit resolutions. This allows higher refresh rates and
    requires less memory. As a drawback, some accelerated
    graphics operations and cpu rendering slows down. Defaults is no, 'PACKED24=NO'
    To enable packed pixel mode change the tooltype to 'PACKED24=YES'

<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>BITMAPCACHE:</B></FONT COLOR>
    For the CyberVisionPPC ONLY! Enable/disable caching of bitmaps
    Caching of bitmaps allows faster window sizing/moving for smart refresh 
    window only, though since smart refresh use extra bitmaps, simple windows 
    only use the screen bitmap. Defaults is 'BITMAPCACHE=YES'. To turn
    the caching of bitmaps off set 'BITMAPCACHE=NO'. Note: BITMAPCACHE tooltype needs at least cgxsystem.library 41.20 to be effective.


<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>USEROXXLER:</B></FONT COLOR>
    For the CyberVision64 ONLY! This will allow all "P2C" to be done by the RoXXler chip on the CV64.
    With the default of 'USEROXXLER=YES' it uses the special planar2chunky hardware on the CV64 to 
    convert planar to chunky, _both_ for fast memory 
    and video memory destinations. If it is set to 'USEROXXLER=NO' then the Trio64 is used for
    p2c, thus only for video memory destionation.. for fastmem destionations the CPU is used. The ENV CPUP2C is always 1 (r69f). 
    Default is on, ie 'USEROXXLER=YES' 
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>OSC1</B></FONT COLOR> and <FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>OSC2:</B></FONT COLOR> 
    For the A2410 ONLY! The A2410 has two oscillators (OSC) on the card near the back by the bracket on the top.
    OSC1 and OSC2 are marked '1' and '2' with the silkscreen. (Also 'X901' and 'X902'.) 
    Default for 1, X901 is 'OSC1=36.000MHZ'. Default for 2, X902 is 'OSC2=66.667MHZ'
    Most all cards shipped from CBM had these two oscillators installed in this configuration.
    If you changed or installed a new oscillators with a different value use this table to
    find the correct value to set the tooltype.<PRE>
 Oscillators Values
-----------------------
 14.318MHZ
 36.000MHZ
 44.98MHZ
 66.667MHZ
 80.00MHZ
</PRE>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>MULTIMEDIAMEM:</B></FONT COLOR> 
    For CyberVision3D/64 ONLY! If 'MULTIMEDIAMEM=YES' CGX will reserve 1MB on the CV64/3D for 3D Textures & Video Overlay options, ie multimedia extensions.
    If 'MULTIMEDIAMEM=NO' the you will get the full 4MB for screens with a Z3 machine (Z2 gets 3.5MB).
    The memory is used as extra video memory (gfx board mem) for amiga bitmaps/screens.
    Also, if it is set to 'NO', the CV64/3D will then act like a card that does not have these options, like a PicassoII.  
    MULTIMEDIAMEM is defaulted to YES (where 3MB can be used for screens). (Note: Z3 config has 256mb space to map regs, z2 config only has 4mb where 3.5mb are used as video mem.
    This is why you don't get the full 4MB with Z2 machines.)
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>BLACKBORDER:</B></FONT COLOR> 
    For Retina BLT Z3 ONLY! By setting 'BLACKBORDER=YES' will cause the 
    border around the screen to be black. The Retina BLT Z3 always uses color0 
    by default where other cards always use black. Default is 'BLACKBORDER=NO'.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>DRAGGING:</B></FONT COLOR> 
   If dragging is disabled by setting
   it to "NO" then it is possible to keep multiple screens in video memory (video memory = the memory on the Graphics Card). This will
   give you very fast screen swaps but you WILL LOSE screen-draging. Currently this is a TRADE OFF... one for the other. You CAN NOT
   do both screen-dragging and have fast screen swaps (keep multiple screens in video memory) at the same time currently! 
   Default setting for the DRAGGING option is "YES". Example: 'DRAGGING=YES'
   <font size=1>(<B>NOTE</B>: Due to a redesign of some driver internals cgxvideo.library up to version
   1.8 and cgx3dvirgin.library up to version 1.5 don't work anymore if
   dragging is disabled. This will be fixed in a forthcoming release.)</font>
   CyberVisionPPC and BlizzardVisionPPC do not support this option.

<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>SCROLLMASK:</B></FONT COLOR> 
    For the CyberVision64/3D & CyberVision64 ONLY. Disables/enables masking when scrolling/moving 
    rectangles with a mask 256 colour modes (e.g. scrolling text in shell windows).
    If you disable masking by specifying "NO", scrolling of e.g. shell text gets faster in 
    256 colours, you get some text crsr refresh problems with e.g. CygnusED though.
    Default setting for the SCROLLMASK option is "YES". Example: 'SCROLLMASK=YES'

<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>MEMCLOCK:</B></FONT COLOR> 
     For the CyberVision64 and Retina BLT Z3 ONLY.  MEMCLOCK is the default memory 
              clock speed in MHz for the graphics memory on the card. Example: 'MEMCLOCK=52'<BR>
<pre>           
Card       Default  Low    High   
-------------------------------------
CVision64  50mhz    50mhz  80mhz
RetinaZ3   63mhz    20mhz  90mhz
</pre><BR>
You may use higher values, although it may lead to problems when you overclock the memory. In
some cases you have to use lower values if the ram is to slow on the board to support faster speeds.
If you have this set to hight you will see pixel droping or see "grabage" on the screen.

<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>BOOTLOGO:</B></FONT COLOR> 
    If this option is disabled (set to No '0'), the CyberGraphX Bootlogo will not be shown at boot time.
    The options can be: 'BOOTLOGO=0' for no bootlogo, or 'BOOTLOGO=1' if you wish to see it.
    If this does not work for you and you wish to have no bootlogo you can rename, move (from libs:) or delete
    the cgxbootpic.libary. Starting with CGX r69f BOOLOGO will now understand YES or NO. So 'BOOTLOGO=NO' for no bootlogo,
    'BOOTLOGO=YES' for a bootlogo.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>PASSTHROUGH:</B></FONT COLOR> 
    If this option is disabled, the monitor switch on 
    that CyberGraphX supported board is deactivated. This option is required for multi monitor systems.
    The options can be: 'PASSTHROUGH=NO'  or 'PASSTHROUGH=YES'.... NOTE: 
    If the ENV NOPASSTHROUGH=0 then the tooltype PASSTHROUGH can be used. If the ENV NOPASSTHROUGH=1 then the tooltype PASSTHROUGH is not used!
    Default is 'PASSTHROUGH=YES'. On the PicassoIV if 'PASSTHROUGH=NO' the flickerfixer is turned off.

<H2>ENV VARs</H2>
CyberGraphX stores all of its 'global' config files in env:CyberGraphX (and are backed-up in envarc:CyberGraphX)
NOTE: the ENV(ARC): directory is now call CyberGraphX in V3/V4. Not Cybergraphics as in V2.
<P>
What IS needed is the EnvVar is your Monitor and its setting file. In these examples we will use PicassoII but you just need
to replace PicassoII with your board name. Board(s) can be: 
CVision3D, CVision64, Spectrum, Piccolo, PiccoSD64, PicassoII, Inferno,<BR>
<B>AGA-PPC</B> does NOT have a AGAMonitor!
<P>
PicassoIIMonitor is a TEXT file that contains the name of the MonitorConfigFile you wish to use.
CyberGraphX comes with a few default config files: 31khz, 35khz, 38khz, 48khz, 57khz, 64khz, 80khz. 
So if your monitors max khz is 57khz and you selected this option in the installer the file
'Monitor-57khz' should be in the sys:prefs/presets/monitors dir & the ENV:CyberGraphX/PicassoMonitor (a text file)
should have 'Monitor-57khz' in it.<P>
<p>

ENV VARs and what they do.<BR>
The EnvVars in env(arc):CyberGraphX are not needed for CyberGraphX, BUT
you can set them to what you want to make CyberGraphX act the way you want.
There are a few tools to making setting these EnvVars easy like CyberPrefsX, a script
to read/change/set them. The EnvVars are just text files with a '0' or '1' in them.
If the EnvVar has a '0' or the files is not found then that feature is not tuned on or disabled.
If the EnvVar has a '1' in it that feature is turned on. NOTE: if the ENV var is not there (the file) then it is the same as the Default mode, for that ENV, in most cases OFF or 0.

    It was added in 41.12 (r69a archive) but since it could interfere with some 
    hacks widely spread, it is disabled by default. It can be enabled by now
    in CGX 41.21 by setting 'env:cybergraphx/WBPATSPEEDUP' to '1'. It is off by default,
    or you can turn it off by setting 'env:cybergraphx/WBPATSPEEDUP' to '0'

<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>NOPASSTHROUGH:</B></FONT COLOR>
    THIS IS A MASTER SWITCH. If this option is enabled, the monitor switch on every 
    CyberGraphX supported board is deactivated. This option is 
    required for multi monitor systems. It is disabled by default, you have to set 'envarc:cybergraphx/NOPASSTHROUGH'
    to "1" to enable it. If NOPASSTHROUGH=0 then the tooltype PASSTHROUGH can be used. If NOPASSTHROUGH=1 then the tooltype PASSTHROUGH is not used!
    Default is 0.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>SUPERGELS:</B></FONT COLOR> 
    A replacement for the original CyberGraphX GELs system. GELs =
    Graphic ELementS, this includes stuff like blitter objects and effects the speed of
    stuff like moving icons or opus drag and drop stuff. It will also give you 
    superimposed dragging in hi/truecolor! The value of this variable is ONLY 
    checked at boot time.  
    It is disabled by default, you have to set 'envarc:cybergraphx/SUPERGELS'
    to "1" to enable it. (New with r69) 
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>USESEMAPHORES:</B></FONT COLOR>
    Lets CyberGraphX use Semaphores to avoid disabling of 
    multitasking under certain conditions. The value of this variable is ONLY 
    checked at boot time. Enabling this option may lead to lockups under 
    certain conditions but is more system friendly in general because 
    multitasking is not disabled during certain drawing operations. (New with r67)
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>SUPERLAYERS:</B></FONT COLOR>
     New layers replacement.   Will  speed  layers  up  a  lot,
    especially when using many windows for the AmigaOS.  It is disabled by default, you have to
    turn it on to use it! Set envarc:CyberGraphX/SUPERLAYERS to "1" to enable it. 
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>CPUP2C:</B></FONT COLOR>
    By setting this variable, the planar-to-chunky conversion 
    will be done by the CPU (in contrast to the blitter conversion) 
    Therefore the ugly looking planar blitting effects are gone, 
    but the software conversion is slower. If you have a CV64 then this is always set to 1 (r69f), see USEROXXLER tooltype. 
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>HIRESCRSR:</B></FONT COLOR>
    By setting this variable, the Lores-Sprites on non-AA-machines 
    become Hires-sprites (they are no longer doubled by 
    the CyberGraphX-Software). 
    This variable is identical to the tooltype HIRESSPRITE of older Picasso-monitor files.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>HIDE15BIT:</B></FONT COLOR>
    By setting this variable, you can switch off 15bit modes to reduce 
    screenmode list length. The Modes are still available but hidden.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>ALERTEMU:</B></FONT COLOR>
    By setting this variable, DisplayAlert(), (The Screens you get when the machine crashes.) 
    will be placed on an CyberGraphX screens.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>PLANES2FAST:</B></FONT COLOR>
    With this option on, non displayable planar bitmaps 
    are allocated in fast memory. This options speeds up 
    handling of planar bitmaps but could lead to problem s
    with amiga graphics which insist on planar graphics 
    placed in chip memory. Take care when using this option.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>KEEPAMIGAVIDEO:</B></FONT COLOR>
    If this option is enabled, everytime a CyberGraphX display 
    becomes frontscreen, Amiga display DMA is left on in order 
    to increase chipmem access speed. By default this is 0 and Amiga display DMA is turned off when a CGX screen is in front.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>SAVEMEM:</B></FONT COLOR>
    If this option is on, CyberGraphX will reduce memory consumption in less or equal 16 colour 
    modes, CyberGraphX keeps a planar representation of the screen 
    bitmap in fastmem and a chunky representation in video memory.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#FF0000><B>NOCHIPSCREEN:</B></FONT COLOR> This has been removed from CyberGraphX V3/V4
